---

## Phase 1: Validation (Weeks 1-4)

### Goal
Get 10 paying customers at full price ($79/month) through direct outreach.

### Primary Channel: Local Business Directory Outreach

**Why this channel:**
- Every target customer is listed on Google Maps/Yelp
- Can see business size, reviews, and contact info
- Personalization is possible (mention their business specifically)
- Zero cost beyond time

**Process:**

1. **Build prospect list (Day 1-2)**
   - Search Google Maps: "[industry] near [city]"
   - Filter: 4+ stars, 50+ reviews (indicates established business)
   - Capture: Business name, owner name (if visible), website, phone
   - Target: 200 prospects in first list

2. **Research and personalize (Ongoing)**
   - Check their website for owner name
   - Read recent reviews for context
   - Note: Number of employees (if visible), service area, specialties

3. **Outreach sequence:**
   - **Day 1:** Email or contact form submission
   - **Day 3:** LinkedIn connection request (if found)
   - **Day 5:** Follow-up email
   - **Day 10:** Final follow-up

**Target metrics:**
- 200 outreach attempts
- 4-6% response rate (8-12 responses)
- 50% demo rate (4-6 demos)
- 50% close rate (2-3 customers per 200 outreach)

### Secondary Channel: Facebook Groups

**Target groups:**
- "Cleaning Business Owners" (45K members)
- "Service Business Entrepreneurs" (28K members)
- "House Cleaning Professionals" (38K members)
- "HVAC Technicians & Business Owners" (15K members)
- Industry-specific groups for pool, pest, landscaping

**Approach:**
1. Join 5-10 groups in first week
2. Observe for 1 week - learn language, common complaints
3. Start commenting helpfully on scheduling/invoicing questions
4. Share case study or build-in-public post after first 3 customers
5. Never spam - provide value first

**Target metrics:**
- 5 groups joined
- 10+ helpful comments per week
- 2-3 DM conversations per week
- 1-2 customers per month from groups

### Pricing Strategy for Phase 1

| Offer | When to use | Details |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Full price trial** | Default | 14-day free trial, then $79/month |
| **Extended trial** | High-potential prospect hesitant | 30-day trial |
| **Annual prepay discount** | Committed early adopter | $66/month (2 months free) |

**Do NOT offer:**
- Lifetime deals (devalues product)
- Heavy discounts (attracts wrong customers)
- Free tier (builds non-paying user base)

---

## Phase 2: Traction (Months 2-3)

### Goal
Reach 40 paying customers ($3K MRR) through community presence and referrals.

### Primary Channel: Referral Program

**Why referrals work for this market:**
- Service business owners talk to each other (local networks)
- High trust in peer recommendations
- Low CAC, high conversion rate

**Referral program structure:**
- **Referrer gets:** 1 month free ($79 value)
- **Referred gets:** Extended 30-day trial
- **Trigger:** Ask at 30 days (after they've seen value)

**Referral activation sequence:**
1. Day 7: "How's it going?" check-in
2. Day 14: NPS survey
3. Day 30: Referral ask (if NPS > 7)
4. Day 45: Referral reminder with specific ask

**Template:**
> "Hey [Name], you mentioned things are going well with the scheduling. I'm curious - do you know any other service business owners who might be dealing with the same chaos you were? If you send them my way, I'll comp your next month. Just have them mention your name when they sign up."

**Target metrics:**
- 30% of customers refer at least one person
- 50% conversion rate on referrals
- Average 0.5 referrals per customer (viral coefficient)

### Secondary Channel: Reddit

**Target subreddits:**
- r/sweatystartup (92K) - Ideal: service business focused
- r/smallbusiness (2.5M) - Broader, but relevant
- r/EntrepreneurRideAlong (200K) - Build in public friendly
- r/Entrepreneur (2.5M) - Occasional relevant threads

**Approach:**
1. Build in public - share journey, numbers, learnings
2. Answer questions about service business operations
3. Post case studies (with customer permission)
4. AMA after hitting 25 customers

### Content Creation (Light)

**Not heavy content marketing yet - just enough to:**
- Have something to share in communities
- Give prospects something to read before demo
- Build SEO foundation for later

**Content calendar (2 posts/month):**
| Week | Topic | Format |
|------|-------|--------|
| Week 1 | "How I got my first 10 customers" | Build-in-public post (Reddit/Twitter) |
| Week 3 | "[Industry] scheduling best practices" | Blog post |
| Week 5 | Customer case study | Blog + Social |
| Week 7 | "Jobber vs [Product] comparison" | Blog post (SEO play) |

---

## Phase 3: Scale (Months 4-6)

### Goal
Reach 100 customers ($8K MRR) with sustainable acquisition channels.

### Primary Channel: Referrals + Word of Mouth

By this phase, referrals should be generating 40-50% of new customers.

**Amplification tactics:**
- Featured case studies on landing page
- "Powered by [Product]" badge for customer booking pages
- Customer community/Slack group for tips sharing
- Quarterly customer advisory calls

### Secondary Channel: Content Marketing / SEO

**Long-tail keyword targets:**
- "house cleaning business scheduling software" (200 searches/mo)
- "pool service route management app" (150 searches/mo)
- "field service software for small business" (400 searches/mo)
- "Jobber alternative" (900 searches/mo)
- "Housecall Pro alternative" (400 searches/mo)

**Content types:**
1. **Comparison pages:** "[Product] vs Jobber" - captures buying intent
2. **Industry guides:** "Complete guide to running a cleaning business"
3. **Tool roundups:** "Best scheduling apps for pest control companies"

### Tertiary Channel: Strategic Partnerships

**Partnership opportunities:**
- QuickBooks/Xero integration partnerships
- Local trade associations (cleaning, pest control)
- Business coaches who serve service businesses
- Podcast sponsorships (after validation)

## GTM Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Don't build before selling.** Validate demand with landing page + discovery calls before shipping features.

2. **Don't spray and pray.** 50 highly personalized outreach > 500 templated emails.

3. **Don't offer heavy discounts.** Attracts price-sensitive customers who churn.

4. **Don't wait for product to be "ready."** Launch with core features, iterate based on feedback.

5. **Don't ignore warm leads.** A referral who expresses interest is 10x more valuable than a cold lead.

6. **Don't spread across too many channels.** Master one channel before expanding.

## Key Decision Points

### Week 4 Check-in
- **If 10+ customers:** Scale what's working (likely outreach + referrals)
- **If 5-9 customers:** Iterate messaging, double outreach volume
- **If <5 customers:** Revisit ICP, messaging, or product-market fit

### Month 3 Check-in
- **If 40+ customers:** Begin content investment, consider hire
- **If 25-39 customers:** Double down on referrals, extend timeline
- **If <25 customers:** Pivot or kill decision
