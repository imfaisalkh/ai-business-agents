- SEO rankings
- Email list size

### Phase 2 (Traction - Months 2-3)
Focus on:
- Trial signups
- Trial-to-paid rate
- Channel attribution
- Referral rate

Add tracking for:
- CAC by channel
- Time to trial

## Key Insight

**In validation phase, talk to people > track metrics.**

Metrics become meaningful when you have 50+ trials and 10+ customers. Before that, focus on qualitative learning from customer conversations.

The only metric that truly matters: **Number of paying customers.**
