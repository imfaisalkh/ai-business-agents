## Positioning Statement

**For** small home service businesses (1-10 employees) **who** waste hours on scheduling chaos, paper invoices, and coordinating workers via text,

**[Product Name]** is a **field service management app**

**that** brings all their jobs, workers, and invoices into one simple place they can run from their phone.

**Unlike** Jobber and Housecall Pro, which charge $200+/month with expensive per-user fees,

**we** offer a flat $79/month for unlimited users - no feature gating, no growth penalties.

## Core Value Proposition

### The One-Liner
> "Stop losing jobs to chaos. Manage your service business from one app - $79/month, unlimited users."

### The Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
> "We built the field service app that Jobber should have been. Small service businesses - cleaners, pool guys, pest control - they're wasting hours every week on scheduling, chasing invoices, texting their workers. They try Jobber and get hit with $200+ bills that go up every time they hire someone. We charge $79/month, flat. Unlimited users. All features included. We're 70% cheaper and 10x simpler."

### The Problem Story (2 minutes)
> "Let me tell you about Mike. He runs a 6-person cleaning company. Every morning he wakes up to 15 text messages - workers asking where to go, customers asking when someone's coming, complaints about missed appointments. He spends 2 hours before his first job just coordinating everyone. His invoices? They're on scraps of paper in his truck. He has $15K in unpaid jobs he keeps meaning to chase. He tried Jobber once - $249/month, plus $29 for every worker he adds. He quit after 2 months. Now he's back to spreadsheet chaos. We built this for Mike. One app. Everyone's on it. Jobs don't fall through cracks. Invoices go out automatically. And it costs less than his phone bill."

**Key messages:**
- "Know exactly which house your cleaners are at, right now"
- "Recurring jobs auto-schedule. No more manual rebooking every week."
- "Customers can reschedule themselves - fewer calls, fewer headaches"

**Language notes:** "Cleaners" not "technicians," "house" not "property," keep it simple

### Segment 2: Pool Service Companies

**Pain point focus:** Route optimization, seasonal fluctuations, chemical tracking (later)

**Key messages:**
- "Organize your routes so you're not zigzagging across town"
- "Flat pricing means you're not penalized during slow winter months"
- "Before/after photos prove the work was done"

**Language notes:** "Routes," "stops," "pools" - industry terminology

### Segment 3: Pest Control Operators

**Key messages:**
- "Never miss a quarterly treatment again - automatic scheduling and reminders"
- "Job notes and photos create a service history for every property"
- "Customers can request emergency service through the portal"

**Language notes:** "Treatments," "properties," "service history" - compliance matters

### Segment 4: Landscaping / Lawn Care

**Pain point focus:** Crew management, seasonal hiring, weather dependencies

**Key messages:**
- "Add seasonal workers without paying per-user fees"
- "Reschedule weather-delayed jobs in one click"
- "Before/after photos for every property - show the work, get the referral"

**Language notes:** "Crews," "properties," "jobs" - team-based language

## Social Proof Strategy

### Testimonial Templates (collect these exact quotes)

**The Numbers Quote:**

### Case Study Format

```
