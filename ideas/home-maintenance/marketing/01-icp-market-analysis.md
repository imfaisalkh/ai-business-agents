## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### Primary ICP: The Overwhelmed Owner-Operator

- Owner-operators of small home service businesses with 1-10 employees
- Annual revenue: $100K-$500K (sweet spot: $200K-$300K)
- Job volume: 50-200 jobs/month
- Mix of recurring maintenance contracts and one-time service calls

**Demographics:**
- Age: 35-55 years old
- Often started as a technician, now running the business
- Non-technical - uses smartphone but not "software savvy"
- Values simplicity and reliability over features
- Often works IN the business (doing jobs) while also managing it

**Industries (prioritized by fit):**
1. **House cleaning services** - High volume, recurring, simple job structure
2. **Pool service/maintenance** - Route-based, recurring, seasonal peaks
3. **Pest control** - Mix of recurring and one-time, route optimization matters
4. **Landscaping/lawn care** - Seasonal, crew-based, photo documentation valuable
5. **Handyman services** - Variable jobs, estimates needed, time tracking important
6. **HVAC/Plumbing** - Higher ticket, complex scheduling, parts tracking (later)

**Psychographics:**
- Frustrated by admin work stealing time from billable hours
- Embarrassed by missed appointments or lost invoices
- Skeptical of software (burned before by complex/expensive tools)
- Word-of-mouth driven - trusts peer recommendations
- Price sensitive but willing to pay for clear value

### Secondary ICP: The Growing Service Business

**Who they are:**
- Service businesses scaling from 5 to 15+ employees
- Currently on Jobber/Housecall Pro but frustrated by costs
- Revenue: $300K-$1M
- Actively hiring, adding routes, expanding service area

**Pain point intensity:** HIGH - per-user pricing is actively costing them money as they grow

## Key Insights

1. **Price is the wedge.** Competitors have created an opening by raising prices. A $79 flat-rate offering is differentiated enough to get attention.

2. **Trust is earned, not bought.** Service business owners trust peer recommendations over ads. Focus on making 10 customers wildly successful, let them spread the word.

3. **Simplicity wins.** These owners don't want more features - they want fewer clicks. Every feature we don't build is a competitive advantage.

4. **Seasonal dynamics matter.** Pool service, landscaping, pest control have huge seasonal swings. Flat pricing (not per-user) helps during slow months.

5. **Mobile-first is non-negotiable.** Field workers live on their phones. If the mobile app sucks, the product fails - regardless of how good the admin dashboard is.
