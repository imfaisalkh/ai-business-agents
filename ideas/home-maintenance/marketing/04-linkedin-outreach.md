# LinkedIn Outreach System

*Generated on January 28, 2026*

---

## Overview

LinkedIn is a secondary channel for this ICP (most service business owners aren't active on LinkedIn), but it's valuable for:
1. Finding owner names for personalized outreach
2. Reaching the "professional" segment (larger operations, 5-10 employees)
3. Building credibility through content
4. Connecting with industry influencers and podcasters

**Primary outreach should be via email/contact forms.** LinkedIn supplements this.

```

### Template 2: Industry Group Member

```
Hi [First Name],

We're both in [Group Name] - I've seen your comments about [topic they discussed]. Good stuff.

I'm working on a project for small home service businesses and trying to learn from folks who actually run them. Mind if we connect?

## Follow-Up Message Sequences

### Sequence A: Accepted Connection - Discovery Path

**Goal:** Learn about their business, qualify, potentially offer demo

**Message 1 (Day 0 - after they accept):**
```
Thanks for connecting, [First Name]!

Quick question - what's the biggest headache running [Company Name] right now? Scheduling? Finding workers? Something else?

Just curious - I talk to a lot of service business owners and everyone's got their thing.
```

**Message 2 (Day 3 - if they respond with a pain point):**
```
Yeah, [pain point] is brutal. I hear that from almost every [industry] owner I talk to.

I'm actually building an app to solve exactly that - specifically for small teams like yours. Too early to pitch anything, but would you be open to a 15-min call so I can learn more about how it shows up for you?

No sales BS - just trying to build something that actually works for people like you.
```

**Message 3 (Day 3 - if no response to Message 1):**
```
Hey [First Name], no worries if you're slammed.

I'm building a field service app for small teams - scheduling, invoicing, worker coordination. $79/month flat, no per-user fees (unlike Jobber's $249/month).

If that sounds interesting, happy to show you what we're building. If not, no sweat - good luck with the business!
```

### Sequence B: Accepted Connection - Direct Path

**Goal:** For prospects who clearly fit (found via Jobber-related search, etc.)

**Message 1 (Day 0):**
```
Thanks for connecting!

Quick one - are you using any software to manage jobs and scheduling right now? (Jobber, Housecall Pro, spreadsheets, or just winging it?)

Working on something in this space and curious what's working/not working for folks.
```

**Message 2 (Day 3 - if they mention current tool or pain):**
```
Got it - [their answer context].

We just launched something that might be relevant: field service app, $79/month flat (unlimited users), covers scheduling + invoicing + mobile app for your workers.

Want me to send a quick 3-min video walkthrough? No commitment, just so you can see if it's worth a closer look.
```

**Message 3 (Day 7 - if no response):**
```
Hey [First Name], last ping from me.

If you ever want to chat about [industry] operations stuff, I'm around. Good luck with [Company Name]!
```

## Content Strategy for LinkedIn

### Post Types That Work

**1. Behind-the-scenes build posts**
```
Building field service software for small businesses.

Today's challenge: How do you design a scheduling screen that works for someone checking it between jobs, in their truck, on a phone?

Talked to 8 cleaning business owners this week. Here's what I learned:
- They need to see the WHOLE day at once (not just next job)
- Color coding by worker matters more than I thought
- "Drive time" between jobs is invisible in most tools

Shipping the first version this weekend. Will share what happens.
```

**2. Customer win stories (with permission)**
```
Got a message from a customer yesterday that made my week:

"For the first time in 5 years, I took a vacation and didn't get 50 calls about scheduling."

She runs a 6-person cleaning company in Austin. Before using our app, Sunday nights were spent planning the whole week via text messages.

Now her workers just open the app, see their jobs, and go.

This is why I build software.
```

**3. Industry insight posts**
```
Talked to 47 home service business owners this month.

The #1 complaint wasn't what I expected.

It wasn't "finding customers" (they have plenty).
It wasn't "hiring" (hard, but manageable).

It was: "I spend more time coordinating than doing actual work."

Scheduling. Invoices. Where's this worker? When's that customer expecting us?

The admin overhead is killing small service businesses.

Building something to fix this. More soon.
```

**4. Comparison/opinion posts**
```
Hot take: Jobber's per-user pricing is holding back small service businesses.

Hear me out.

A 5-person cleaning company pays $249/month for Jobber.
Add a part-time helper for summer? +$29/month.
Bring on your spouse to help with admin? +$29/month.

By the time you have 10 people, you're paying $400+/month for software.

Meanwhile, you're making 10-20% margins on a $200K business.

That's not sustainable.

We need field service software with flat pricing. Built for small teams, not enterprise.

Building exactly that. $79/month. Unlimited users.

Am I crazy, or does this resonate?
```

## Profile Optimization

### Headline
```
Building field service software for small home service businesses | $79/month, unlimited users
```

### About Section
```
I'm building the field service app that small home service businesses actually deserve.

After talking to hundreds of cleaning companies, pool service operators, and pest control businesses, I kept hearing the same thing: "Software is either too expensive or too complicated."

Jobber charges $249/month with per-user fees. ServiceTitan wants $400+ and a 12-month contract.

Meanwhile, you're running a 5-person operation trying to keep jobs from falling through the cracks.

That's why I'm building [Product Name]:
- $79/month flat. No per-user fees.
- Scheduling, invoicing, and a mobile app for your workers
- Built specifically for 1-10 employee service businesses

Currently working with cleaning companies, pool services, and pest control operators.

If you run a home service business and want to chat about operations, shoot me a message. Happy to share what I'm learning.
