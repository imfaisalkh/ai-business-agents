## Outreach Scripts

### Cold Email - Standard

**Subject:** Quick question about [Company Name]

```
Hi [Name],

I came across [Company Name] while researching [industry] businesses in [City]. Impressive reviews!

Quick question: how are you handling scheduling and invoicing with your team? Still coordinating via texts and spreadsheets?

I'm building a field service app specifically for small teams - $79/month flat, no per-user fees (unlike Jobber's $200+).

Would a quick 15-minute call be useful? Either way, good luck with the business!

[Your name]
```

### Cold Email - Jobber Alternative Angle

**Subject:** Saving [industry] businesses $2,000+/year

```
Hi [Name],

I talk to a lot of [industry] business owners who are frustrated with what they're paying for Jobber or Housecall Pro.

Quick math: 5-person team on Jobber = $314/month = $3,768/year.

We built the same core features for $79/month flat. That's $2,820/year back in your pocket.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if it fits your operation?

[Your name]
```

### Cold Email - Problem-Focused

**Subject:** The scheduling headache

```
Hi [Name],

Let me guess: you spend your mornings texting workers about who goes where, and your evenings doing invoices you should have sent days ago.

I've talked to 50+ [industry] owners this year. That pattern is almost universal.

We built an app to fix exactly that. $79/month. Everything in one place.

Interested in a quick look?

[Your name]
```

### LinkedIn Connection Request

```
Hi [Name],

I noticed you run [Company Name] - great reputation in [City]!

I'm building software for small service businesses and would love to connect with people who actually run them.

[Your name]
```

### LinkedIn DM After Connection

```
Thanks for connecting, [Name]!

Quick question - what's the biggest headache running [Company Name] right now? Scheduling? Finding workers? Something else?

Just curious - I talk to a lot of service business owners and everyone's got their thing.
```

## Phone Scripts

## Discovery Call Script

### Full 25-Minute Script

**Opening (2 min)**

```
Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time.

Quick housekeeping - this isn't a sales pitch. I want to understand how you're running things today and see if what we're building actually helps. If it's not a fit, I'll tell you. Sound good?

Great. I saw you run [Company Name] in [City]. How long have you been doing that?
```

**Current Situation (8 min)**

```
Walk me through a typical day for you. What does your morning look like?

[Listen - look for coordination overhead]

How do you decide who does which job each day?

[Listen - look for tools and pain points]

And how do your workers know where to go and what to do?

[Listen - look for communication methods]

What happens when a job is done? What's the process after that?

[Listen - look for invoicing delays]
```

**Pain Exploration (8 min)**

```
What's the most frustrating part of running your business day-to-day?

[Listen - let them identify the pain]

Can you tell me about the last time that happened?

[Listen - get the specific story]

How often does that happen?

[Listen - quantify frequency]

What does it cost you when that happens? Time? Money? Stress?

[Listen - quantify impact]

On a scale of 1-10, how much of a problem is this? 10 being "I'd pay anything to fix it."
```

**Previous Attempts (5 min)**

```
Have you tried any software to help with this?

[If yes] What did you try? What happened?
[If no] What's stopped you from trying something?

What do you currently spend on business software each month?

If you were to try something new, what would make you say "yes"?
```

```

## Demo Script

### 15-Minute Product Demo

**Confirm Pain (2 min)**

```
Before I show you anything, let me make sure I got this right.

Your main challenge is [pain point], which costs you [time/money]. And you've [tried X / been doing it with Y].

Did I get that right? Anything to add?
```

**Show Solution (10 min)**

```
Alright, let me show you exactly how you'd handle [their specific pain].

[Screen share - open product]

First thing you see is the dashboard. This is your command center.

[Navigate to scheduling]

Here's where [their pain] gets solved. Let me create a job like you would...

[Create job using their example]

See how I assigned that to a worker? They'll see it on their phone like this...

[Show mobile app view]

Now imagine it's 5pm and the job is done. Here's how you get paid...

[Show invoicing flow]

One click from the completed job, invoice is ready. Send it by email or text. Customer pays online. Done.

[Show two-way messaging]

And this is the feature our customers love most - two-way texting. This is included, not extra like Jobber's $349 plan.

[Pause for questions]

Any questions so far?
```

**Trial Offer (3 min)**

```
So that's the basic flow. Does this look like it would solve [their pain]?

[If yes]

Great. Want to get you started today?

I'll set you up with a 14-day free trial. No credit card required. You can add your actual customers, schedule real jobs, and see if it fits.

[Start signup process together]

Let me get you logged in right now...
```

## Objection Response Scripts

### Price Objections

**"It's too expensive"**
```
I hear you - price matters. What are you comparing it to?

[If Jobber/Housecall Pro]

Actually, we're about 70% cheaper. Jobber for a 5-person team is $314/month. We're $79. That's $235/month you'd save - almost $3,000 a year.

[If "just expensive in general"]

Let me ask you this: how much time do you spend on scheduling and admin each week? If it's 5 hours at $50/hour, that's $1,000/month in your time. We cost $79.
```

**"Can I get a discount?"**
```
I appreciate you asking. Here's the thing - we're already 70% cheaper than Jobber.

What I can offer is an annual plan at $66/month - that's two months free. Saves you $156/year.

Would that work?
```

### Timing Objections

**"I need to think about it"**
```
Totally fair. It's your business and you want to make the right call.

What specifically are you thinking through? Is it the price, the features, or something else?

[Address the real concern]
```

**"Now's not a good time"**
```
I get it - running a business is hectic.

What's happening right now that makes this bad timing?

[Listen...]

Makes sense. When would be a better time to revisit this? Can I follow up in [suggest timeframe]?
```

### Trust Objections

**"I've never heard of you"**
```
Fair point - we're newer to the market.

Here's the thing: we're not Jobber with 10 years of brand recognition, but we're also not charging Jobber prices.

We have [X] customers who switched from bigger tools and are happy. Would it help to talk to one of them?
```

**"I tried software before and it was a disaster"**
```
Tell me more about that - what went wrong?

[Listen...]

That makes sense. [Address their specific bad experience]

What would you need to see to feel confident this would be different?
```

## Closing Scripts

### Trial-to-Paid Conversion

**Standard Close**
```
You've been using [Product] for [X] days now. You've scheduled [Y] jobs and sent [Z] invoices.

How's it been going?

[Listen for positive signals]

Great to hear. Your trial ends in [X] days.

To keep using everything, it's $79/month with everything included. Want me to set up your subscription now?
```

**If They Hesitate**
```
What's holding you back?

[Listen...]

[Address the concern]

Would it help to [offer solution - extended trial, call with customer, etc.]?
```

### Referral Ask (Day 30+)

```
Hey [Name], I wanted to check in. How's everything going with [Product]?

[Listen for positive feedback]

Really glad to hear that!

Quick question - do you know any other [industry] business owners who might be dealing with the same scheduling chaos you were?

If you send them my way, I'll give you a free month - $79 credit.

Just have them mention your name when they sign up.
```
