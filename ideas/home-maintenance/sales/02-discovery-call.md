## Purpose

The discovery call is NOT a sales pitch. It's a conversation to:
1. **Understand** their specific situation
2. **Qualify** if we can actually help them
3. **Build trust** by listening more than talking
4. **Bridge** to a demo if there's fit

**Duration:** 20-30 minutes
**Structure:** 80% listening, 20% talking

## Call Structure

### Phase 1: Opening (2 minutes)

**Goal:** Set expectations, build rapport

**Script:**

> "Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time. I'm [Your name]."
>
> "Before we dive in - this isn't a sales pitch. I want to understand how you're running things today and see if what we're building might actually help. If it's not a fit, I'll tell you."
>
> "I'll ask some questions about your business, and then if it makes sense, I can show you what we've built. Sound good?"
>
> "Quick question to start - I saw you run [business type] in [city]. How long have you been doing that?"

**Tips:**
- Be human, not corporate
- Match their energy level
- Acknowledge their time is valuable

### Phase 2: Current Situation (8 minutes)

**Goal:** Understand how they work today

**Questions:**

1. **Day structure:**
> "Walk me through a typical day for you. What does your morning look like?"

*Listen for:* Coordination overhead, manual processes, time spent on admin

2. **Scheduling:**
> "How do you decide who does which job each day?"

*Listen for:* Tools used (calendar, texts, paper), pain points, workarounds

3. **Worker coordination:**
> "How do your workers know where to go and what to do?"

*Listen for:* Communication method, information gaps, miscommunication stories

4. **After the job:**
> "What happens when a job is done? What's the process?"

*Listen for:* Invoicing delays, payment collection, documentation

**Active Listening Techniques:**
- "Tell me more about that..."
- "So what you're saying is..."
- "That sounds frustrating. How often does that happen?"

### Phase 3: Pain Exploration (8 minutes)

**Goal:** Quantify their pain and understand urgency

**Questions:**

5. **Identify pain:**
> "What's the most frustrating part of running your business day-to-day?"

*Don't suggest answers - let them identify it*

6. **Get specific story:**
> "Can you tell me about the last time [their pain] happened?"

*Stories reveal true severity*

7. **Quantify impact:**
> "How much time would you say that takes you each week?"
> "What does it cost you when that happens? Time? Money? Stress?"

*Anchor to real numbers*

8. **Severity check:**
> "On a scale of 1-10, how much of a problem is this for you? 10 being 'I would pay anything to fix it.'"

*Calibrate urgency - below 7 is a yellow flag*

### Phase 4: Previous Attempts (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Understand their buying history and objections

**Questions:**

9. **Software history:**
> "Have you tried any software to help with this?"

*If yes:* "What did you try? What happened?"
*If no:* "What's stopped you from trying something?"

10. **Current spend:**
> "What do you currently spend on business software? Excluding accounting."

*Establishes budget anchor*

11. **Decision criteria:**
> "If you were to try something new, what would make you say 'yes'?"

*Reveals objections early*

### Phase 5: Bridge to Demo (3 minutes)

**Goal:** Transition to showing the solution

**If Good Fit:**

> "Based on what you've shared, it sounds like [summarize pain] is costing you [quantify].
>
> "We built something specifically for this. It's a field service app that handles scheduling, worker coordination, and invoicing in one place. $79/month flat, unlimited users.
>
> "Want me to show you how it works? Takes about 15 minutes."

**If Unclear Fit:**

> "I want to make sure this is actually right for you. Based on what you've shared, [concern]. Let me show you how it works and you can tell me if it would actually help."

**If Not a Fit:**

> "I appreciate you sharing all this. Honestly, based on what you've described, I'm not sure we're the right fit because [reason].
>
> "[Alternative suggestion] might be a better option for you. But if your situation changes, feel free to reach out."

## Handling Common Responses

### When They Say "We're Fine"

> "That's good to hear. What's working well for you?"
>
> *[Let them talk - often they'll reveal pain anyway]*
>
> "Makes sense. Out of curiosity, if you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about your operations, what would it be?"

### When They Go Off-Topic

> "That's interesting - I want to make sure we cover everything. Let me note that and come back to it. You were saying about [original topic]..."

### When They Ask About Price Early

> "Great question. It's $79/month flat, unlimited users. But before I get into details, I want to make sure it's even the right fit. Can you tell me more about [back to questions]?"

### When They're Skeptical

> "Totally fair to be skeptical - a lot of software overpromises. What would you need to see to believe this could actually help?"

### When They're In a Hurry

> "I can tell you're busy - let me ask just two quick questions to see if this is worth your time, and if so, we can schedule something later."

## Practice Scenarios

### Scenario 1: House Cleaning Owner

**Setup:** Sarah runs a 5-person cleaning company. She's currently using Google Calendar and texts.

**Practice:** Ask the discovery questions, identify her likely pain (coordination), quantify (hours spent texting), bridge to demo.

### Scenario 2: Pool Service Skeptic

**Setup:** Mike has a 3-person pool service. He tried Jobber 2 years ago and hated it.

**Practice:** Understand why Jobber failed, what would make him try again, differentiate on price and simplicity.

### Scenario 3: Paper-Based Holdout

**Setup:** John runs a pest control business with 4 techs. He uses paper job tickets.

**Practice:** Understand why he hasn't gone digital, quantify the cost of paper chaos, show low-risk entry.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Pitching too early** - Don't describe features until you understand their pain
2. **Talking too much** - If you're talking more than 20% of the time, you're doing it wrong
3. **Leading the witness** - "Don't you find scheduling frustrating?" → "Tell me about scheduling"
4. **Skipping quantification** - Always get numbers (hours, dollars, frequency)
5. **Ignoring red flags** - If they're not ICP, exit gracefully
6. **Forgetting next steps** - Always end with clear action (demo, follow-up, close)
