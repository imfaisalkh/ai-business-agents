## Quick Qualification Script

### 30-Second Version (for initial contact)

> "Quick question before we set up time - how many people are on your team, and what are you using to manage jobs and scheduling right now?"

**Decode responses:**

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| "5 people, we use spreadsheets" | PROCEED - ideal ICP |
| "8 people, using Jobber but it's expensive" | PROCEED - switcher |
| "Just me, I keep it all in my head" | CAUTION - may not need software |
| "25 technicians, we use ServiceTitan" | EXIT - too large |
| "We don't really track it" | PROBE - might be opportunity or might not be serious |

### 2-Minute Qualification (after response)

If initial response is positive:

> "Got it. What made you interested in exploring something new?"

**Listen for:**
- Pain trigger (recent missed job, growing pains)
- Budget indicator (complaining about current tool cost)
- Timeline signal (urgent need vs. casual browsing)

> "Makes sense. Who makes decisions about tools like this at your company?"

> "And when were you hoping to have something in place?"

**Decision:** Schedule call or exit gracefully

## Disqualification Signals

### Immediate Disqualifiers (Exit Now)

| Signal | Example | Response |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Wrong size | "Just me and my wife as a hobby" | "We're built for larger teams. [Suggestion] might be better for you." |
| Wrong industry | "We do office cleaning for corporations" | "We focus on residential services. You might check [competitor]." |
| No budget | "We never pay for software" | "Totally understand. If that changes, feel free to reach out." |
| No authority | "I'm just the office manager" | "Could you connect me with the owner?" |
| No need | "Our Jobber setup is working great" | "Glad it's working! If that changes, we're here." |

### Yellow Flags (Proceed with Caution)

| Signal | Risk | Action |
|--------|------|--------|
| Price-focused questions | May churn if cheaper option appears | Qualify harder on pain |
| "Just exploring" | No urgency, may waste time | Set timeline expectations |
| Partner approval needed | Decision not in their control | Ask to include partner |
| Heavy feature questions | May have enterprise expectations | Clarify we're for small teams |
| Previous bad experience | Trust issues | Understand what went wrong |

## Exit Scripts

### Polite Exits for Disqualified Prospects

**Too Small:**
> "We're really built for teams with 3+ employees who need to coordinate workers. For a smaller operation, [free tool suggestion] might be a better fit. But keep us in mind as you grow!"

**Too Large:**
> "Honestly, we're built for small teams - 1 to 10 employees. For a 50-person operation, you'd probably outgrow us quickly. [Competitor like ServiceTitan] might be a better fit for your scale."

**Wrong Industry:**
> "We're really focused on residential home services - cleaning, pool, pest control. For [their industry], [specific alternative] might be a better fit since they have [relevant features]."

**No Pain:**
> "It sounds like things are running pretty smoothly for you - that's great! We're really best for businesses that are struggling with [problem]. If that ever changes, feel free to reach out."

**Not Decision Maker:**
> "I appreciate you reaching out. Would it be possible to include [decision maker] in our next conversation? I want to make sure we're talking to the right person."

**No Budget/Timeline:**
> "Totally understand. Timing is everything. Would it be okay if I followed up in [timeframe]? In the meantime, feel free to poke around our website."

## Red Flag Recognition Practice

### Scenario 1
> "I run a cleaning business, it's mostly just me, sometimes my daughter helps on weekends."

**Answer:** Disqualified - too small (solo operator). Exit gracefully.

### Scenario 2
> "We have 8 technicians but our office manager handles all the scheduling. She's not on this call."

**Answer:** Yellow flag - need to get office manager and/or owner on call. Ask to include decision maker.

### Scenario 3
> "We're using Jobber but the cost is killing us. We have 6 cleaners and pay almost $300/month."

**Answer:** Highly qualified - right size, active pain, budget exists. Schedule discovery immediately.

### Scenario 4
> "We might look at software next year when things slow down after the holidays."

**Answer:** Yellow flag - no urgency. Probe for pain to create urgency, or schedule follow-up for later.

### Scenario 5
> "We do commercial office cleaning for property management companies."

**Answer:** Disqualified - B2B/commercial, not residential. Exit gracefully.
