## Objection Handling Framework

### The LAER Method

| Step | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **L**isten | Let them fully express the concern | Show respect, understand true objection |
| **A**cknowledge | Validate their concern | Build trust, don't dismiss |
| **E**xplore | Ask questions to understand root cause | Find the real objection |
| **R**espond | Address with relevant information | Overcome with facts, not pressure |

### Golden Rules

1. **Never argue.** You can't win an argument and win a customer.
2. **The first objection is rarely the real one.** Dig deeper.
3. **Objections are buying signals.** They're engaging, not dismissing.
4. **Silence is your friend.** After responding, pause. Let them process.

## Price Objections

### "It's too expensive"

**Listen:** "I hear you - price is always a consideration."

**Acknowledge:** "You want to make sure you're getting value for every dollar."

**Explore:** "When you say too expensive, what are you comparing it to?"

**Respond (based on answer):**

| Comparison | Response |
|------------|----------|
| "Jobber/Housecall Pro" | "Actually, we're about 70% cheaper. Jobber charges $169 base plus $29/user. For a 5-person team, that's $314. We're $79 flat. You'd save $235/month - nearly $3,000/year." |
| "Free tools" | "Free tools like spreadsheets work, but how much time do they cost you? If you spend 5 hours a week on admin at $50/hour, that's $1,000/month in your time. We cost $79." |
| "Nothing/General" | "Help me understand - is it that $79 is too much, or that you're not sure it's worth $79? Because if it saves you even 2 hours a week, that's easily worth $79." |

### "Can you give me a discount?"

**Listen:** "I appreciate you asking."

**Acknowledge:** "Everyone wants the best deal."

**Explore:** "What would a discount mean for you - would you commit today if I could offer something?"

**Respond:**

> "Here's what I can do. We're already priced 70% below competitors. What I can offer is an annual plan at $66/month - that's two months free. That saves you $156/year. Would that work?"

**If they push further:**

> "I understand. Our pricing is pretty firm because we're already so much cheaper than alternatives. What I can offer is an extended 30-day trial so you can be completely sure before committing."

### "I need to think about the price"

**Listen:** "Totally fair."

**Acknowledge:** "It's a real expense and you want to make sure it's right."

**Explore:** "What specifically are you weighing? Is it the monthly cost, or something else?"

**Respond (based on answer):**

| Real concern | Response |
|--------------|----------|
| Cash flow | "I get it. Would annual billing help? It's $66/month instead of $79 - might be easier to budget annually." |
| Uncertain value | "What would you need to see during the trial to feel confident it's worth $79? Let's make sure you hit that." |
| Partner approval | "Would it help to have a quick call with your partner? I'm happy to walk them through it too." |

## Feature Objections

### "Does it have [specific feature]?"

**If we have it:**
> "Yes! Let me show you how that works..."

**If it's planned:**
> "That's on our roadmap for [timeframe]. Right now, [explain current workaround]. Would that work for you in the short term?"

**If we don't have it:**
> "That's not something we offer today. Can you tell me more about how you'd use that? I want to understand if there's another way we can solve that problem."

### "It's missing [feature that Jobber has]"

**Listen:** "Good point."

**Acknowledge:** "Jobber has been around 13 years - they have a lot of features."

**Explore:** "How often do you actually use that feature? Is it a daily thing or occasional?"

**Respond:**

> "Here's our philosophy: we build the 20% of features that matter 80% of the time. [Feature] is something most small teams don't use regularly, so we focused on [what we do well]. Does that make sense for how you'd use it?"

### "Your mobile app isn't native"

**Listen:** "You're right, it's a PWA, not a native app."

**Acknowledge:** "I understand the preference for native apps."

**Explore:** "What's your main concern - speed, offline access, or something else?"

**Respond:**

> "We built it as a PWA because your workers can access it instantly - no app store download, works on any phone. It loads in under 2 seconds and works offline for viewing jobs. Have you tried it on a phone? Most people can't tell the difference."

---

## Timing Objections

### "I need to think about it"

**Listen:** "Of course."

**Acknowledge:** "It's a decision that affects your whole business."

**Explore:** "Totally understand. What's the main thing you're thinking through?"

**Respond (based on answer):**

| Real concern | Response |
|--------------|----------|
| Not sure about value | "What would help you feel more confident? More time in trial? A call with an existing customer?" |
| Need partner input | "Would it help to do a quick demo with your partner? I'm happy to schedule that." |
| Busy right now | "When would be a better time to revisit this? Can I follow up in [X] weeks?" |
| Stalling (no real reason) | "I want to be respectful of your time. If you're not ready, that's totally fine. But if something's holding you back, I'd rather address it now." |

### "Now's not a good time"

**Listen:** "I get it - timing matters."

**Acknowledge:** "Running a business is hectic."

**Explore:** "What's happening right now that makes this bad timing?"

**Respond (based on answer):**

| Reason | Response |
|--------|----------|
| Busy season | "Actually, busy season might be the best time - that's when the chaos is worst. What if we got you set up now so you're ready for the rush?" |
| Slow season | "Makes sense to wait for busier times. Can I follow up in [month]? In the meantime, you could try the free trial and learn the system when it's slower." |
| Other priorities | "What's the bigger priority right now? [Listen] Got it. When do you think this would move up the list?" |

### "Let me try the free trial first"

**Listen:** "Absolutely, that's what it's for."

**Acknowledge:** "I want you to be completely confident before paying."

**Support:**
> "Great, let's get you set up. A couple things that help people get the most out of the trial: First, add your customers and schedule at least 5 jobs. Second, have one of your workers download the app and complete a job. That way you'll really see if it fits. When can we touch base to see how it's going - Thursday?"

---

## Trust Objections

### "I've never heard of you"

**Listen:** "Fair point."

**Acknowledge:** "We're newer to the market."

**Respond:**

> "You're right - we're not Jobber with 10 years of brand recognition. But here's the thing: we're also not charging Jobber prices. We have [X] customers who switched from bigger tools and are happy. Would it help to talk to one of them? I can connect you with a cleaning company owner in [city]."

### "How do I know you'll be around?"

**Listen:** "That's a valid concern."

**Acknowledge:** "You don't want to set everything up and have us disappear."

**Respond:**

> "Here's what I can tell you: we're profitable, we're growing, and we're in this for the long haul. But I understand the concern. That's why we don't require long contracts - you can leave anytime. Your data is yours and we make it easy to export. So you're not locked in."

### "What if it doesn't work for my business?"

**Listen:** "Good question."

**Acknowledge:** "Every business is different."

**Respond:**

> "That's exactly why we have a 14-day free trial with no credit card required. You can set up your actual business - your customers, your workers, your jobs - and see if it works. If it doesn't fit, nothing lost. But I've yet to meet a [cleaning/pool/pest] company that it didn't work for."

### "I tried software before and it was a disaster"

**Listen:** "Tell me more about that."

**Acknowledge:** "Bad software experiences are frustrating."

**Explore:** "What went wrong? Was it the software itself, the onboarding, or something else?"

**Respond (based on answer):**

| What went wrong | Response |
|-----------------|----------|
| Too complicated | "We built this for small teams, not enterprises. Most people are up and running in an hour. Let me show you how simple it is." |
| Too expensive | "That's exactly why we charge $79 flat. No per-user fees, no surprise charges." |
| Workers didn't use it | "That's a real challenge. Our mobile app is dead simple - if your workers use Google Maps, they can use this. Want to see it?" |
| Bad support | "I personally respond to every support request within 4 hours. We're a small team and we care about every customer." |

## Competitor Objections

### "I'm already using Jobber"

**Listen:** "How's that working for you?"

**Explore:** "What made you look at alternatives?"

**Respond (based on answer):**

| Their pain | Response |
|------------|----------|
| Too expensive | "We're 70% cheaper. You'd save $[calculate] per month. That's $[annual] per year." |
| Too complicated | "We built for small teams only. No enterprise features you don't need." |
| Missing features | "What feature would you want that Jobber doesn't have?" |
| Happy with it | "Sounds like it's working for you - that's great! If that changes, keep us in mind." |

### "What makes you different from [competitor]?"

**Listen:** "Good question."

**Respond:**

> "Three things:
> 1. **Price** - We're $79 flat, unlimited users. No per-user fees that add up as you grow.
> 2. **Simplicity** - We only build features small teams actually use. No enterprise bloat.
> 3. **Everything included** - Two-way SMS, customer portal, mobile app - all included. No premium tiers."

### "Competitor X has more features"

**Listen:** "You're probably right."

**Acknowledge:** "They've been around longer and raised a lot of money."

**Respond:**

> "Here's the question: do you use all those features? In my experience, small teams use about 20% of what Jobber offers. We focused on that 20% and made it really, really good. Plus, you're not paying for features you don't use."

## Stall Tactics

### "Send me some information"

**Listen:** "Happy to."

**Explore:** "What specifically would be helpful - pricing, features, something else?"

**Respond:**

> "I can send that over. But honestly, the best way to understand it is to see it in action - takes about 15 minutes. Would tomorrow at [time] work for a quick demo? That way you can ask questions in real time."

### "I'll get back to you"

**Listen:** "Sounds good."

**Pin it down:**

> "When do you think you'll have a chance to decide? Can I follow up [specific day]?"

### "Let me talk to my partner"

**Listen:** "Makes sense."

**Respond:**

> "Totally understand - it's a team decision. Would it help to have a quick call with both of you? That way they can ask questions directly. When are you both available?"

## The Nuclear Option: Walk Away

Sometimes the best close is being willing to walk away.

### When to Use It

- They've raised 3+ objections and won't commit
- They're clearly not a fit but haven't admitted it
- The conversation is going in circles

### How to Do It

> "Look, I want to be respectful of your time. It sounds like you have some real concerns about [summarize]. I don't want to pressure you into something that isn't right. Why don't I follow up in a month and see if anything has changed? In the meantime, feel free to try the free trial whenever you're ready."

This often triggers one of two responses:
1. "Wait, I do have one more question..." (real objection surfaces)
2. "Thanks, I appreciate that." (they weren't going to buy anyway)

Both outcomes are better than prolonged stalling.
