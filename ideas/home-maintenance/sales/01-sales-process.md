# Sales Process Design

## Sales Model

**Founder-Led Sales** with a high-touch, consultative approach.

This is NOT enterprise sales:
- No multi-stakeholder deals
- No procurement processes
- No 90-day sales cycles

This IS small business sales:
- Owner is the decision maker
- Decisions made quickly (1-2 weeks)
- Relationships and trust matter
- Price transparency wins

## Sales Stages

```
Lead → Qualified → Discovery → Demo → Trial → Activation → Closed Won
                                                              ↓
                                                         Referral
```

### Stage Definitions

## Target Metrics

### Pipeline Metrics

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Outreach/week | 50-100 | Emails, LinkedIn, contact forms |
| Response rate | 5% | 2.5-5 responses per 50-100 outreach |
| Qualification rate | 70% | Of responses, how many are ICP |
| Discovery call rate | 50% | Of qualified, how many take a call |
| Demo rate | 80% | Of discovery calls that continue to demo |
| Trial start rate | 60% | Of demos that start trial |
| Trial-to-paid rate | 30% | Of trials that convert |

### Conversion Funnel (Per 100 Outreach)

```
100 Outreach
 │
 ├── 5 Responses (5%)
 │    │
 │    ├── 3.5 Qualified (70%)
 │    │    │
 │    │    ├── 1.75 Discovery Calls (50%)
 │    │    │    │
 │    │    │    ├── 1.4 Demos (80%)
 │    │    │    │    │
 │    │    │    │    ├── 0.84 Trials (60%)
 │    │    │    │    │    │
 │    │    │    │    │    └── 0.25 Customers (30%)
```

**Math:** 400 outreach/month → ~1 customer
**Goal:** 10 customers/month = 4,000 outreach (200/week)

*Alternative: Focus on higher-converting channels (referrals, communities)*

### Time Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Lead → Qualified | < 2 days |
| Qualified → Discovery | < 3 days |
| Discovery → Demo | Same call or next day |
| Demo → Trial | Same day |
| Trial → Paid | < 14 days |
| **Total cycle** | **< 21 days** |

## Sales Process by Stage

### Stage 1: Lead Generation

**Sources:**
1. **Outbound:** Local business directory scraping + cold email
2. **Inbound:** Landing page signups, trial starts
3. **Communities:** Facebook groups, Reddit
4. **Referrals:** Customer introductions

**Actions:**
- Add to tracking spreadsheet
- Research business (Yelp, website, LinkedIn)
- Personalize outreach message
- Send initial contact (email, LinkedIn, contact form)

**Exit to Qualified:**
- They responded
- Initial information gathered

### Stage 2: Qualification

**Goal:** Determine if they're worth spending time on.

**BANT+ Criteria:**

| Criteria | Qualified | Disqualified |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| **B**udget | Has software budget ($50-200/mo) | "We don't pay for software" |
| **A**uthority | Owner or decision maker | "I need to ask my partner" |
| **N**eed | Active pain (scheduling, invoicing) | "We're fine with spreadsheets" |
| **T**imeline | Looking to solve now | "Maybe next year" |
| **Team size** | 1-10 employees | Solo hobby or 20+ employees |
| **Industry** | Home services (cleaning, pool, pest, etc.) | Commercial, B2B, retail |

**Quick Qualification Script:**
> "Quick question before we set up time - how many people are on your team, and what are you using to manage jobs right now?"

**Exit to Discovery:**
- Meets BANT+ criteria
- Agreed to discovery call
- Calendar invite sent

### Stage 3: Discovery Call

**Goal:** Understand their specific situation and pain.

**Duration:** 20-30 minutes

**Structure:**
1. Rapport building (2 min)
2. Their situation (8 min)
3. Their pain (8 min)
4. Their attempts (5 min)
5. Bridge to demo (2 min)

**Key questions:**
- "Walk me through how you manage scheduling today."
- "What's the most frustrating part?"
- "How much time does that take you each week?"
- "Have you tried software before? What happened?"

**Exit to Demo:**
- Clear understanding of pain
- They want to see solution
- Time scheduled (or continue immediately)

### Stage 4: Demo

**Goal:** Show them exactly how we solve their problem.

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes

**Structure:**
1. Confirm their top pain (2 min)
2. Show the solution (10 min)
3. Address questions (5 min)
4. Trial offer (3 min)

**Demo flow:**
1. "Based on what you told me, scheduling is the biggest issue. Let me show you how this works..."
2. Create a job (use their example if possible)
3. Show calendar view with team
4. Show mobile worker app
5. Show invoicing flow
6. Show two-way messaging

**Exit to Trial:**
- "Does this look like it would solve [their pain]?"
- If yes: "Let's get you set up right now"
- Create account together on call

### Stage 5: Trial

**Goal:** Get them to experience value quickly.

**Duration:** 14 days

**First 24 hours (critical):**
- Send welcome email with quick-start guide
- Follow up call: "Hey, just checking in - did you get logged in okay?"
- Help them add first customer and job

**Day 3-7:**
- Check if workers are using mobile app
- Help troubleshoot any issues
- Share relevant tip/feature

**Day 10-14:**
- If activated: "How's it going? Ready to go live?"
- If not activated: "What's blocking you? Can I help?"

**Exit to Activation:**
- Created first job
- Invited at least one worker
- Worker completed a job
- Sent first invoice

### Stage 6: Close

**Goal:** Convert trial to paid subscription.

**Timing:** Day 10-14 of trial (before it ends)

**Close conversation:**
> "You've been using [product] for about 10 days now. You've scheduled [X] jobs and sent [Y] invoices. How's it been?"

*[Listen for positive signals]*

> "Great to hear. Your trial ends in [X] days. To keep using it, it's $79/month with everything included. Want me to set up your subscription now?"

**If hesitation:**
- Address specific concern
- Offer annual discount ($66/month)
- Offer extended trial if they need more time (30 days total)

**If no:**
- Understand why (product, price, timing?)
- Offer to follow up in 30 days
- Ask for referral anyway

### Stage 7: Referral

**Goal:** Turn customers into acquisition channel.

**Timing:** Day 30+ (after they've seen value)

**Trigger:** NPS > 7 or verbal positive feedback

**Ask:**
> "Glad it's working for you! Quick question - do you know any other service business owners who might be dealing with the same scheduling chaos you were? If you send them my way, I'll give you a free month."

**Referral program:**
- Referrer: 1 free month ($79 value)
- Referred: 30-day trial (extended)
- Track via "How did you hear about us?"
