# Follow-Up System

*Generated on January 28, 2026*

## Why Follow-Up Matters

**80% of sales require 5+ follow-ups.**
**But 44% of salespeople give up after 1 follow-up.**

The fortune is in the follow-up. Most prospects aren't saying "no" - they're saying "not yet."

## Email Templates

### Cold Outreach Templates

**Initial Email:**
```
Subject: Quick question about [Company Name]

Hi [Name],

I noticed you run [Company Name] in [City] - great reviews on [Yelp/Google].

Quick question: How are you handling scheduling and invoicing with [X] workers? Still using spreadsheets and texts, or have you found something that works?

I'm building a field service app specifically for small teams like yours - $79/month flat, no per-user fees.

Happy to share more if you're interested. Either way, good luck with the business!

[Your name]
```

**Follow-up #1 (Day 3):**
```
Subject: Re: Quick question about [Company Name]

Hi [Name],

Just floating this to the top of your inbox in case it got buried.

Would love to hear how you're managing things - even if our tool isn't the right fit, I'm always learning from service business owners.

[Your name]
```

**Follow-up #2 (Day 10):**
```
Subject: Different approach

Hi [Name],

I know you're busy running a business, so I'll keep this short.

One of our customers (a cleaning company in Austin) told me they save about 8 hours a week since switching from spreadsheets. Mostly from not having to coordinate everyone via text.

If that sounds appealing, I'm happy to do a quick 15-minute demo. If not, no worries - I'll stop bugging you.

[Your name]
```

**Breakup Email (Day 14):**
```
Subject: Should I stop reaching out?

Hi [Name],

I've sent a few emails and haven't heard back - totally get it, you're busy.

I don't want to be annoying, so I'll assume the timing isn't right.

If things change and you want to chat about scheduling/invoicing for your business, you know where to find me.

Good luck with everything!

[Your name]
```

Any questions, just reply here.

Hi [Name],

I saw you've scheduled [X] jobs and added [Y] customers - nice!

**Day 15 Win-Back:**
```
Subject: Did we miss something?

Hi [Name],

I noticed you didn't continue after the trial ended.

I'm genuinely curious: was it the product, the price, or just bad timing?

If there's something we could have done better, I'd love to hear it. And if you just need more time, I can extend your trial.

[Your name]
```

**Day 60 Win-Back:**
```
Subject: Still using spreadsheets?

Hi [Name],

It's been about 2 months since you tried [Product].

I'm curious - how's it going? Did you find another solution, or are you back to spreadsheets?

If you want to give us another shot, I can set you up with an extended trial and personally help with setup.

Either way, hope business is going well!

[Your name]

## Follow-Up Best Practices

### Timing

| Day | Best time to send | Rationale |
|-----|-------------------|-----------|
| Mon | 10am-11am | After morning catch-up |
| Tue | 9am-10am | Most productive day |
| Wed | 10am-11am | Mid-week check-ins |
| Thu | 2pm-3pm | Before end-of-week rush |
| Fri | 9am-10am | Catch them before weekend mode |

**Avoid:** Monday early AM, Friday PM, weekends (for B2B)

### Subject Lines That Work

| Type | Example | Why it works |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Question | "Quick question about scheduling" | Curiosity |
| Personal | "Saw your review on Yelp" | Shows research |
| Direct | "Your trial ends tomorrow" | Urgency |
| Casual | "Checking in" | Non-threatening |
| Breakup | "Should I stop reaching out?" | Pattern interrupt |

### Follow-Up Rules

1. **Always have a next step.** Every email should make it clear what happens next.
2. **Add value each time.** Don't just say "following up" - share something useful.
3. **Change the angle.** If one approach isn't working, try a different value prop.
4. **Use multiple channels.** Email → LinkedIn → Phone → Email
5. **Set reminders.** Never rely on memory. Use calendar blocks.
6. **Know when to stop.** After 5 touches with no response, move to nurture.
