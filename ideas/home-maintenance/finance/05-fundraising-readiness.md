## Fundraising Philosophy

**This is a bootstrap-first business.**

Fundraising is NOT the goal. The goal is profitability and sustainable growth.

Consider fundraising ONLY if:
1. Unit economics are proven (LTV:CAC > 5:1)
2. Growth is limited by capital, not product-market fit
3. A specific opportunity requires capital to capture
4. You want to accelerate an already-working playbook

**Default mode:** Grow from revenue. Profitable > Funded.

## Current Fundraising Readiness

### Assessment (Pre-Revenue)

| Criteria | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Product built | Not yet | MVP in development |
| Paying customers | Not yet | Target: 10 in Month 1 |
| Revenue | $0 | Target: $3K MRR by Month 3 |
| Unit economics | Projected | Need real data |
| Market validation | Partial | Need more customer conversations |
| Team | Solo founder | Technical + business skills |

**Current Status: NOT READY FOR FUNDRAISING**

This is expected and fine. Focus on customers, not investors.

## Investor Types

### Who to Talk To

| Type | Check Size | Fit | When |
|------|------------|-----|------|
| **Angel investors** | $10-100K | Great for pre-seed | After first 10 customers |
| **Micro VCs** | $100-500K | Good for seed | After $5-10K MRR |
| **Traditional VCs** | $1M+ | Later stage | After $50K+ MRR |
| **Revenue-based financing** | $50-500K | Alternative to equity | After predictable revenue |

### Who to Avoid

| Type | Why |
|------|-----|
| VCs too early | Will say no, waste time |
| Strategic investors (competitors) | Information risk |
| Investors who don't understand SMB SaaS | Wrong advice |
| Anyone pushing for hyper-growth at expense of unit economics | Wrong fit for bootstrap mindset |

## Alternative Funding Options

### Bootstrap-Friendly Financing

| Option | Amount | Terms | Best For |
|--------|--------|-------|----------|
| **Pipe/Clearco** | 1-12x MRR | Revenue share | Scaling marketing |
| **SBA Loan** | $50-350K | 6-8% interest | Working capital |
| **Stripe Capital** | Based on volume | Revenue share | Bridging cash flow |
| **Indie.vc** | $100-500K | Equity + profit share | Aligned with bootstrap |
| **Earnest Capital** | $100-500K | Shared earnings | Bootstrap-friendly |

### Pros and Cons

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Equity (VC/Angel) | No repayment, strategic help | Dilution, loss of control |
| Revenue-based | No dilution, aligned with growth | Payments reduce cash flow |
| Debt (SBA) | No dilution, low rates | Personal guarantee, repayment |
| Bootstrapping | Full control, no obligations | Slower growth, personal risk |

## Decision Framework: To Raise or Not

### Raise If:

1. **Growth is constrained by capital, not product**
   - You have more qualified leads than you can handle
   - CAC payback < 6 months
   - Clear path to scale marketing

2. **Specific strategic opportunity**
   - Competitor is vulnerable (Jobber raising prices)
   - Market timing is critical
   - Network effects to capture

3. **Team expansion needed**
   - Proven playbook, need people to execute
   - Founder is bottleneck

### Don't Raise If:

1. **Churn is high (>7%)**
   - Money won't fix retention
   - Need to fix product/onboarding first

2. **CAC is high or unknown**
   - Don't scale broken economics
   - Need to prove acquisition channels first

3. **Product-market fit unclear**
   - More money = more efficient waste
   - Need customer validation first

4. **You don't want to give up control**
   - VCs will want board seats
   - Will push for outcomes that may not align

## If You Decide to Raise

### Timeline

| Week | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 1-2 | Prepare deck, data room, financial model |
| 3-4 | Practice pitch, get feedback |
| 5-8 | Investor meetings (aim for 30-50) |
| 9-12 | Term sheet negotiation, due diligence |
| 13-16 | Legal, close round |

### Tips

1. **Raise when you don't need to** - best terms come from position of strength
2. **Have FOMO working for you** - multiple interested parties
3. **Know your walk-away number** - don't accept bad terms
4. **Understand term sheets** - read "Venture Deals" by Brad Feld
5. **Get referrals** - warm intros convert 10x better

---

## Current Recommendation

### For Home-Maintenance SaaS

**Recommendation: Bootstrap to $10K MRR before considering fundraising.**

**Rationale:**
1. Unit economics look excellent - don't need money to validate
2. Market is large but not winner-take-all - no rush
3. Solo founder can get to profitability without outside capital
4. Maintaining control allows for sustainable business decisions

**If you reach $10K MRR and want to accelerate:**
- Consider revenue-based financing first (Pipe, Clearco)
- If equity needed, angel/micro-VC round of $250-500K
- Use funds to hire first salesperson and scale outreach
