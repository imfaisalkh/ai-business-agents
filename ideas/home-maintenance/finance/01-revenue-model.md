## Revenue by Stream (Target Scenario)

### Month 6 Breakdown

|--------|---------|------------|
| Subscription MRR | $11,692 | 94% |
| Payment Processing | ~$740 | 6% |
| **Total MRR** | **$12,432** | 100% |

### Payment Processing Math

- Average customer invoice volume: $5,000/month
- % paid online: 40% = $2,000
- Our margin (0.5%): $10/customer/month
- At 148 customers: $1,480/month

## Annual Plan Impact

If 30% of customers choose annual plans:

| Plan | Customers | Revenue Type |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| Monthly ($79) | 104 | $8,216 MRR |
| Annual ($792/yr = $66/mo effective) | 44 | $34,848 upfront |

**Benefits:**
- Immediate cash: $34,848 vs waiting for monthly
- Lower effective churn (annual commitment)
- Better LTV prediction

## Revenue Milestones

| Milestone | MRR | Customers | Timeline |
|-----------|-----|-----------|----------|
| First $1K MRR | $1,000 | 13 | Month 1-2 |
| First $3K MRR | $3,000 | 38 | Month 2-3 |
| First $5K MRR | $5,000 | 64 | Month 4 |
| First $10K MRR | $10,000 | 127 | Month 5-6 |

## Pricing Sensitivity Analysis

### What if we charged more?

| Price | Expected Conv Rate | 100 Trials = | MRR Impact |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| $79 | 30% | 30 customers | $2,370 |
| $99 | 25% | 25 customers | $2,475 |
| $129 | 20% | 20 customers | $2,580 |

**Insight:** Higher price = fewer customers but similar MRR. But fewer customers = slower word-of-mouth growth.

### What if we charged less?

| Price | Expected Conv Rate | 100 Trials = | MRR Impact |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| $79 | 30% | 30 customers | $2,370 |
| $59 | 35% | 35 customers | $2,065 |
| $49 | 40% | 40 customers | $1,960 |

**Insight:** Lower price doesn't compensate for revenue loss.

**Conclusion:** $79 is the optimal price point for balancing growth and revenue.

## Revenue Growth Levers

### 1. Reduce Churn (Highest Impact)

| Churn Rate | Month 6 Customers | Month 6 MRR |
|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 7% | 125 | $9,875 |
| 5% | 148 | $11,692 |
| 3% | 175 | $13,825 |

**1% churn reduction = ~$1,900/month MRR by Month 6**

### 2. Increase Trial Conversion

| Conversion Rate | Month 6 Customers | Month 6 MRR |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 25% | 123 | $9,717 |
| 30% | 148 | $11,692 |
| 35% | 173 | $13,667 |

**5% conversion improvement = ~$2,000/month MRR by Month 6**

### 3. Increase Outreach Volume

| Weekly Outreach | Monthly Trials | Month 6 MRR |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| 100 | 20 | $9,480 |
| 150 | 30 | $14,220 |
| 200 | 40 | $18,960 |

**50% more outreach = ~50% more MRR**

## Key Revenue Metrics to Track

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **MRR** | Monthly Recurring Revenue | Growing 15%+ MoM |
| **Net MRR Growth** | New MRR - Churned MRR | Positive every month |
| **MRR per Customer** | MRR / Customers | $79 (stable) |
| **Annual Plan %** | Annual / Total customers | 30%+ |
| **Quick Ratio** | (New + Expansion) / Churn | > 4 |

---

## Revenue Forecasting Model

### Simple Formula

```
Month N MRR = (Month N-1 Customers × (1 - Churn%)) × $79 + (New Customers × $79)
```

### Example

```
Month 3 MRR = (32 × 0.95) × $79 + (25 × $79)
           = 30.4 × $79 + 25 × $79
           = $2,402 + $1,975
           = $4,377
```
