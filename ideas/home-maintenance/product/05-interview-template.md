## Discovery Interview Script

### Before the Call

**Preparation:**
- Research their business (Yelp, Google, website)
- Note: team size, reviews, service types
- Prepare 3 specific questions about their business

**Setup:**
- Video call preferred (build rapport)
- Ask permission to record
- Send calendar invite with Zoom/Meet link

### Opening (2 min)

> "Hi [Name], thanks so much for taking the time. Really appreciate it."
>
> "Just to set expectations - this isn't a sales call. I'm building software for service businesses and want to make sure I'm solving real problems. I'm here to learn from you."
>
> "I'll ask about how you run your business day-to-day, what works, what's frustrating. There are no wrong answers - I just want to understand your reality."
>
> "Is it okay if I record this? It's just so I can focus on listening instead of note-taking. I won't share it anywhere."
>
> "Any questions before we start?"

### Warm-up (3 min)

1. "Tell me a bit about your business. What services do you offer?"

2. "How long have you been running it?"

3. "How many people are on your team?"

*[Let them talk - don't rush. Build rapport.]*

### Current State (8 min)

4. "Walk me through a typical day for you. What does your morning look like?"

*[Listen for: When they wake up, first tasks, coordination overhead]*

5. "How do you decide who does which job each day?"

*[Listen for: Tools used, manual process, pain points]*

6. "What do you do when a job finishes? What's the process after that?"

*[Listen for: Invoicing process, payment collection, documentation]*

7. "How do your workers know where to go and what to do?"

*[Listen for: Text coordination, app usage, miscommunication]*

### Problem Exploration (8 min)

8. "What's the most frustrating part of running your business day-to-day?"

*[Don't suggest answers - let them identify the pain]*

9. "Can you tell me about the last time [their pain point] happened?"

*[Get specific story - this reveals true severity]*

10. "How often does that happen?"

*[Quantify frequency]*

11. "What does it cost you when that happens? Time? Money? Stress?"

*[Quantify impact]*

12. "On a scale of 1-10, how much of a problem is this for you? 10 being 'I would pay anything to fix it.'"

*[Calibrate severity - anything below 7 isn't urgent enough]*

### Current Solutions (5 min)

13. "Have you tried any software or tools to help with this?"

*[If yes:]* "What did you try? What happened?"
*[If no:]* "What's stopped you from trying something?"

14. "What do you currently spend on business software? (Excluding accounting)"

*[Establishes budget anchor]*

15. "If you could wave a magic wand, what would it do for your business?"

*[Gets desired outcome without biasing toward solution]*

### Willingness to Pay (3 min)

16. "If there was a tool that [solved their specific problem], what would that be worth to you?"

*[Open-ended first]*

17. "Would $79/month for unlimited users be: A) A no-brainer, B) Worth considering, or C) Too expensive?"

*[Direct price test]*

18. "What would make you say 'yes' to trying something new?"

*[Identifies decision criteria]*

### Closing (2 min)

> "This has been incredibly helpful. Thank you."
>
> "I'm building something that might help with [problem]. Would you be interested in being an early user? I'd give you a big discount in exchange for feedback."

*[If yes:]* "Great - I'll email you when we're ready. What's the best email?"

*[If maybe:]* "No pressure at all. Can I follow up in a few weeks to show you what we've built?"

> "Do you know any other [industry] business owners who might have similar challenges? I'd love to talk to them too."

> "Thanks again - this was really valuable."

## Interview Best Practices

### Do:
- Listen more than you talk (80/20 rule)
- Ask "why" multiple times to get to root cause
- Get specific stories, not general opinions
- Quantify pain (time, money, frequency)
- Let silence happen (they'll fill it)
- Take notes on exact quotes
- Thank them genuinely

### Don't:
- Pitch your product (this is listening time)
- Lead the witness ("Don't you think...")
- Interrupt when they're on a roll
- Defend or explain away issues
- Promise features you can't deliver
- Take negative feedback personally
- Skip the follow-up
