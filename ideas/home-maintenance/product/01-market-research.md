## Competitor Deep Dive

### Tier 1: Direct Competitors (Field Service Management)

#### Jobber

| **Per-user fees** | $29/user/month above plan limits |

| **Weaknesses** | Expensive at scale, feature-gated (2-way SMS on Grow only), complex for small teams |
| **Recent moves** | Raised prices 30% in 2024, added AI features, expanding internationally |

**Strategic insight:** Jobber is moving upmarket (larger customers, higher prices). This creates an opening at the low end.

#### Housecall Pro

- **Acquired by:** ServiceTitan (2023) for $700M+
- **Customers:** 30K+ businesses

| **Per-user fees** | $35/user/month above limits |
| **Strengths** | Good mobile app, marketing tools built-in, strong in HVAC/plumbing |
| **Weaknesses** | Integration with ServiceTitan = enterprise focus, prices rising |
| **Recent moves** | Post-acquisition integration, less SMB focus |

**Strategic insight:** Housecall Pro acquisition by ServiceTitan signals a move away from small businesses.

## Market Trends

### Tailwinds (Working in our favor)

1. **Post-COVID digital adoption**
   - Service businesses forced to adopt digital payments
   - Customers expect online booking and communication
   - Paper-based operations feel outdated

2. **Price sensitivity increasing**
   - Inflation hitting small business margins
   - SaaS fatigue - too many subscriptions
   - Per-user pricing feels unfair

3. **Jobber price increases**
   - 30% increase in 2024 created switching intent
   - "Jobber alternative" searches up 200%
   - Active subreddit discussions about switching

4. **Mobile-first expectations**
   - Workers expect to work from phone
   - Customers expect text updates
   - "There's an app for that" mentality

### Headwinds (Working against us)

1. **Switching costs**
   - Customer data in existing tools
   - Workers trained on current systems
   - "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality

2. **Brand trust**
   - Jobber has 10 years of brand building
   - Small businesses skeptical of new tools
   - "Will you be around in 2 years?"

3. **Feature expectations**
   - Customers expect feature parity with Jobber
   - Comparison shopping is easy
   - Missing features = deal breaker

## Strategic Opportunities

### 1. Price Leadership (Primary Strategy)
- **Opportunity:** 70% cheaper than market leader
- **Risk:** Race to bottom, attracts price-sensitive churners
- **Mitigation:** Position as "right-sized" not "cheap"

### 2. Industry Vertical Focus
- **Opportunity:** Go deep in one industry (cleaning, pool, or pest)
- **Risk:** Limits total addressable market
- **Mitigation:** Start broad, add vertical-specific features later

### 3. "Jobber Alternative" SEO Play
- **Opportunity:** Capture intent-based searches
- **Risk:** Direct comparison invites feature gap scrutiny
- **Mitigation:** Control the narrative with comparison pages

### 4. Community-Led Growth
- **Opportunity:** Service business owners trust peer recommendations
- **Risk:** Slow to scale
- **Mitigation:** Invest in customer success, ask for testimonials early

## Key Takeaways for Product

1. **Must-have features:** Scheduling, invoicing, mobile app, customer portal
2. **Differentiator feature:** Two-way SMS included (competitors charge extra)
3. **Nice-to-have (Phase 2):** Estimates, route optimization, inventory
4. **Skip entirely:** Anything enterprise (complex reporting, roles/permissions)
