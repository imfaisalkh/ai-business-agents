# Pricing Strategy

*Generated on January 28, 2026*

## Pricing Philosophy

**One price. All features. Unlimited users.**

This pricing strategy is built on three principles:
1. **Simplicity** - No mental math, no "which plan do I need?"
2. **Fairness** - No penalty for adding workers (unlike competitors)
3. **Predictability** - Same bill every month, no surprises

## Unit Economics

| Traction | Founder time + referrals | ~$500 | 30 | ~$17 |

*Founder time not counted as cash expense in bootstrap model

**Target CAC:** < $100 (lifetime)

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

| Input | Value | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| ARPU | $89 | Subscription + processing |
| Gross margin | 85% | After Stripe/Twilio costs |
| Monthly churn | 5% | Target |
| Avg lifetime | 20 months | 1 / 0.05 |
| **LTV** | **$1,513** | ARPU × margin × lifetime |

### LTV/CAC Ratio

| Scenario | CAC | LTV | Ratio | Health |
|----------|-----|-----|-------|--------|
| Validation | $0* | $1,513 | Infinite | Great |
| Traction | $50 | $1,513 | 30:1 | Great |
| Scale | $100 | $1,513 | 15:1 | Healthy |

**Healthy LTV/CAC:** > 3:1

### Payback Period

|-----|---------------------|---------|
| $50 | $76 ($89 × 85%) | < 1 month |

## Pricing Psychology

### Why $79?

1. **Below $100 barrier** - Feels like "tens of dollars" not "hundreds"
2. **Above $50 discount tier** - Signals quality, not cheap/risky
3. **Monthly coffee budget framing** - "$2.60/day for your whole team"
4. **Direct competitor comparison** - Clearly cheaper than Jobber's lowest useful tier

### Why Not Lower?

| Price | Risk |
|-------|------|
| $49 | Attracts price-sensitive customers who churn |
| $39 | Leaves money on table, signals "cheap" |
| $29 | Can't sustain business, attracts hobbyists |

### Why Not Higher?

| Price | Risk |
|-------|------|
| $99 | Crosses psychological $100 threshold |
| $149 | Too close to competitors, loses price advantage |
| $199 | Same price as Jobber, why switch? |

### Why Flat Pricing?

1. **Removes friction** - "Should I add this part-timer?" → Yes, it's free
2. **Aligns incentives** - We want them to grow, not minimize seats
3. **Simplifies sales** - One price, no calculator needed
4. **Differentiates** - No one else in market does this

## Pricing Objection Handling

### "How can you be so cheap?"

> "We're built specifically for small teams. We don't have the overhead of enterprise features, big sales teams, or legacy code. We pass those savings to you."

### "What's the catch? What don't I get?"

> "Everything is included. The only thing we don't have is features designed for 50+ person operations - things like complex approval workflows or multi-location management. For a team your size, we have everything you need."

### "What happens when you raise prices?"

> "If we raise prices, existing customers keep their rate. We only raise prices for new customers, and we give at least 90 days notice."

### "Can I get a discount?"

> "We're already priced 70% below Jobber. What I can offer is an annual plan that gives you 2 months free - $66/month instead of $79."

### "My team is just 2 people, that seems expensive"

> "I hear you. But consider: if this saves you 5 hours a week - which our customers typically see - that's worth way more than $79. What's your hourly rate? [$50-100]. So you're getting $1,000/month in time savings for $79."

## Future Pricing Considerations

### What We Might Add (Not Now)

| Add-on | Price | When |
|--------|-------|------|
| Additional SMS bundle | $20/month | If SMS costs exceed $50/customer |
| Priority support | $50/month | When support load requires it |
| API access | $0 (included) | Keep it free to encourage integrations |
| White-label | Never | Not our market |

### When to Consider Price Increase

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Churn < 3% for 3 months | Consider $89 for new customers |
| Feature parity with Jobber | Consider $99 for new customers |
| 500+ customers | Consider tiered pricing (Starter/Pro) |
| Enterprise requests | Ignore - not our market |

### Pricing Experiments to Run

1. **Annual vs monthly mix** - What % choose annual?
2. **Trial length** - 14 days vs 7 days vs 30 days
3. **Credit card on signup** - Does it improve or hurt conversion?
4. **Price anchoring** - Show competitor prices more prominently?
