## Success Criteria

**By End of Week 4, you should have:**
- 10 paying customers (or commitments)
- MVP deployed and stable
- 20+ discovery calls completed
- Clear understanding of ICP and positioning
- Data on what works (channel, messaging, features)

**Decision point:**
- If >10 customers: Scale what's working (channel, features, outreach)

- If <5 customers: Pivot or kill (re-examine ICP, problem, or solution)

## Pro Tips

1. **Don't build in isolation:** Have 1 customer call every day for first 30 days
2. **Ship ugly but working:** Week 3 launch with rough edges beats perfect Week 8 launch
3. **Qualify ruthlessly:** 1 good-fit customer > 10 bad-fit leads
4. **Track one metric per function:**
   - Marketing: Qualified leads/week
   - Product: Weekly active users
   - Sales: Close rate %
   - Engineering: Features shipped/week
   - Finance: Net cash flow
5. **Kill fast:** If <5 customers by Week 4, don't push to Week 8. Pivot or kill.

## What to Do When Stuck

- **No one responds to outreach:** Your ICP or messaging is wrong - Re-read `marketing/01-icp-market-analysis.md` and `marketing/02-positioning-messaging.md`
- **People interested but don't buy:** Qualification is weak - Practice `sales/02-discovery-call.md` and `sales/03-qualification-checklist.md`
- **Customers sign up but don't use:** Onboarding or core feature is wrong - Update PRD, rebuild
- **Too slow to build:** Cut scope - Update PRD at a Glance to 3 features max
- **Competitors seem better:** Find your differentiation wedge - Review `product/01-market-research.md` Strategic Opportunities

---

## Next Steps RIGHT NOW

1. **Read `product/02-prd.md`** - Understand what you're building (30 min)
2. **Read `sales/02-discovery-call.md`** - Practice the call script with a friend (15 min)
3. **Run `engineering/02-setup-guide.md`** - Bootstrap the project (1 hour)
4. **Send first 20 LinkedIn connections** using `marketing/04-outreach.md` templates (30 min)

**Total time investment today:** 2-3 hours
**What you'll have:** Project bootstrapped + first outreach sent + sales process internalized
