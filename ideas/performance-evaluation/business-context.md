## The Problem

**What specific problem are you solving?**
<!-- Be concrete. "Businesses waste 10 hours/week on manual invoice processing" not "Invoicing is hard" -->

Small team managers (5-100 employees) struggle to conduct structured, consistent performance evaluations, resulting in lost documentation, inconsistent feedback, and legal risk. They're forced to choose between prohibitively expensive enterprise tools ($11-16 per employee/month) or basic spreadsheet replacements that lack critical features like employee self-review and peer feedback.

**Who has this problem?**
<!-- Job title, company size, industry -->

- Team managers in small to mid-size companies (5-100 employees), particularly first-time managers with 4-8 direct reports
- Engineering managers, product managers, and operations leads at startups and small agencies
- HR leaders in small companies who wear multiple hats and need simple but comprehensive tools
- Companies that have grown from 5 to 20+ employees and need to formalize their review process

**How are they solving it today?**
<!-- Current alternatives: spreadsheets, competitors, manual processes, ignoring it -->

- Google Sheets/Docs for quarterly reviews (copying from previous quarters, disorganized folder structures)
- Basic performance tools like Small Improvements ($5-8 PEPM) that lack self-review and peer feedback features
- Expensive enterprise tools like Lattice or 15Five (only larger teams with budgets can afford)
- Ad-hoc 1:1 conversations with no documentation or consistency
- Many simply skip evaluations entirely, leading to awkward salary discussions

**Why is the current solution inadequate?**
<!-- Pain points with status quo -->

- **Spreadsheets**: No structure, no employee visibility, no reminders, version control chaos, no historical tracking
- **Enterprise tools**: Too expensive ($11-16 PEPM = $550-2,200/year minimum for small teams), complex setup requiring 1-2 weeks, features small teams don't need
- **Basic tools**: Missing critical features (no employee self-review, no peer feedback, no gap analysis)
- **Ad-hoc approach**: No documentation for legal protection, inconsistent criteria, recency bias, employee dissatisfaction from lack of feedback

## Your Solution

**One-sentence description:**
<!-- "X for Y" or "We help [who] do [what] so they can [outcome]" -->

We help small team managers conduct comprehensive 360-degree performance evaluations with employee self-review, peer feedback, and goal tracking at 50% the cost of enterprise tools.

**Key differentiator (pick ONE):**
<!-- What's the single thing that makes you different? Speed? Price? Simplicity? -->

Enterprise-grade features (self-review with gap analysis, peer feedback, goal tracking) at SMB pricing ($6-8 PEPM vs $11-16 for Lattice) - filling the gap between basic tools and expensive platforms.

**Initial feature set (3-5 features max):**
<!-- Only what's needed to deliver core value -->

1. Employee self-review with manager gap analysis (side-by-side comparison of ratings to drive coaching conversations)
2. Peer review system with anonymized feedback aggregation (360-degree insights without the complexity)
3. Goal setting and tracking with quarterly progress updates (continuity between review cycles)
4. Pre-built role and level-specific templates (Software Engineer, Manager, Sales Rep with Junior/Mid/Senior levels)
5. Team analytics dashboard (completion rates, performance distribution, trend tracking)

## Business Model

**How will you make money?**
<!-- Subscription, one-time, usage-based, freemium -->

SaaS subscription model with per-employee-per-month (PEPM) pricing. All users who receive evaluations are counted (not just active users). 14-day free trial followed by monthly or annual billing.

**Target price point:**
<!-- $X/month or $X one-time -->

$6-8 per employee per month (testing $6 PEPM for early adopters, $7-8 PEPM standard pricing)
- 15-person team: $90-120/month ($1,080-1,440/year)
- 30-person team: $180-240/month ($2,160-2,880/year)

**Why this price?**
<!-- What value does it represent? What are alternatives priced at? -->

- **Value proposition**: 40-50% cheaper than Lattice ($11+ PEPM) while offering same core features (self-review, peer feedback, goal tracking)
- **Time savings**: Gap analysis + self-review saves managers 30 minutes per review. For 10-person team = 5 hours saved/quarter = $250-500 value
- **Competitive positioning**: Premium over basic tools ($5 PEPM) justified by richer features, but accessible for SMBs unlike enterprise tools
- **Target ARPA**: $90-150/month allows sustainable growth with <$200 CAC and 12-month payback
