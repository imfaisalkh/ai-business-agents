# Unit Economics

## Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

### Month 1-6 (Founder-Led Sales)
- **Marketing spend:** $60/month (LinkedIn Premium $50 + hosting $10)
- **Founder time:** 40 hours/month × $50/hour opportunity cost = $2,000
- **Total monthly cost:** $2,060
- **New customers:** 2-3/month
- **CAC:** $687-1,030

### Target CAC (Month 12):** <$500 (as process scales)

## Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

### Calculation
- **ARPA:** $120/month
- **Gross margin:** 85% (SaaS margins: revenue - hosting - payment processing)
- **Churn rate:** 5%/month (estimate, improve to 3%)
- **LTV formula:** ARPA × Gross Margin / Churn Rate
- **LTV:** $120 × 0.85 / 0.05 = **$2,040**

### Sensitivity Analysis
| Churn Rate | LTV |
|------------|-----|
| 3%/month (good) | $3,400 |
| 5%/month (acceptable) | $2,040 |
| 7%/month (bad) | $1,457 |

---

## LTV:CAC Ratio

**Current (Month 6):** $2,040 / $1,000 = **2.0x** (acceptable, but needs improvement)

**Target (Month 12):** $3,400 / $500 = **6.8x** (excellent)

**Benchmark:** >3.0x is healthy SaaS business

---

## CAC Payback Period

**Formula:** CAC / (ARPA × Gross Margin)

**Current:** $1,000 / ($120 × 0.85) = **9.8 months**

**Target:** <12 months (acceptable for bootstrapped SaaS)

## Gross Margin Breakdown (Per $120 MRR Customer)

| Item | Monthly Cost | % of Revenue |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| **Revenue** | $120.00 | 100% |
| Stripe fees (2.9% + $0.30) | $3.78 | 3% |
| Hosting (Vercel/Railway) | $0.50 | 0.4% |
| Email (Resend) | $0.10 | 0.1% |
| Analytics (PostHog) | $0.05 | 0.04% |
| **Total COGS** | $4.43 | 3.7% |
| **Gross Profit** | $115.57 | **96.3%** |

**Note:** 96% gross margin is typical for early-stage SaaS (scales to 85-90% as support costs grow)

## Break-Even Analysis

**Fixed costs (Monthly):**
- Founder salary (opportunity cost): $0 (bootstrapped, reinvesting)
- Tools & software: $60/month
- Hosting (base): $20/month
- **Total fixed:** $80/month

**Break-even MRR:** $80 / 0.85 gross margin = **$94 MRR** (1 customer!)

**Actual break-even (with founder time):**
- Founder time: $2,000/month
- Total fixed: $2,080/month
- Break-even MRR: $2,080 / 0.85 = **$2,447 MRR** (20-25 customers)

**Target:** Break-even by Month 4-5 (20-25 customers)
