- Email service (Resend): $10
- Analytics (PostHog): $0 (free tier)

## Runway (Bootstrapped Scenario)

### Starting Capital: $5,000 (founder savings)

**Out-of-pocket runway:** $5,000 / $82 = **61 months** (5+ years)

**Including opportunity cost:** $5,000 / $5,082 = **1 month** (not viable long-term)

**Reality:** Founder works part-time job or freelance to cover living expenses while building

## Cash Flow Projection (Months 1-12)

| Month | Revenue | Burn | Net Cash Flow | Cumulative Cash |
|-------|---------|------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1 | $0 | $82 | -$82 | $4,918 |
| 2 | $0 | $82 | -$82 | $4,836 |
| 3 | $330 | $82 | +$248 | $5,084 |

| 9 | $4,500 | $582 | +$3,918 | $20,462 |
| 12 | $7,500 | $582 | +$6,918 | $41,216 |

**Key insight:** Cash flow positive by Month 3, $40K+ in bank by Month 12 (fully bootstrapped)

## Risk Mitigation

### If Growth Slower Than Expected
- **Extend runway:** Founder freelances 10 hours/week ($2K/month) to cover burn
- **Cut costs:** Use free tiers (PostHog, Vercel) longer
- **Reduce scope:** Ship faster MVP, skip nice-to-have features

### If Churn Higher Than Expected
- **Fix retention first:** Pause new customer acquisition, improve product
- **Pricing adjustment:** Lower price to $5 PEPM if $6-8 is too expensive
