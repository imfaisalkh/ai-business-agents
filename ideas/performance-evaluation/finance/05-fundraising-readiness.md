## Fundraising Strategy

### Bootstrap-First Approach

| Phase | Strategy | Timeline |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Phase 1** | Bootstrap to $5K MRR | Months 1-6 |
| **Phase 2** | Decide: Continue bootstrap or raise | Month 6-7 |
| **Phase 3** | If raising: Pre-seed/seed | Month 8-12 |

### When to Raise (Decision Framework)

**Stay Bootstrapped If:**
- Growing >20% MoM sustainably
- Unit economics remain strong (LTV:CAC >5:1)
- Runway is comfortable (>12 months)
- No urgent need for capital-intensive growth

**Consider Raising If:**
- Clear opportunity to accelerate with capital
- Competitive pressure requires faster growth
- Enterprise customers need features requiring investment
- Founder needs salary to sustain
