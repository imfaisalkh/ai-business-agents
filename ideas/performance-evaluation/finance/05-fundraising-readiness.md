# Fundraising Readiness Checklist

> **Purpose:** Assess whether TeamPulse should raise funding, and prepare if yes. Bootstrap-first mindset.
>
> **Fits in:** Use after validating unit economics. Reference for conversations with investors.

## Fundraising Philosophy

**Default mode:** Bootstrap
**Raise only if:** Clear use of funds that accelerates proven model

### Questions to Ask Before Raising

1. Can you reach profitability without external capital?
2. Is the market opportunity time-sensitive?
3. Do you have unit economics that work?
4. Will raising actually accelerate growth (not just extend runway)?
5. Are you okay with giving up control/equity?

---

## Bootstrap vs Raise Decision

### Bootstrap If...

- [x] Can reach profitability in <12 months
- [x] Unit economics already work (LTV:CAC >3:1)
- [x] Market isn't winner-take-all
- [x] You want to maintain full control
- [x] Revenue can fund growth
- [x] You enjoy the bootstrapped journey

### Raise If...

- [ ] Market is time-sensitive (competitors with funding)
- [ ] Clear path to 10x growth with capital
- [ ] Unit economics proven but CAC requires upfront investment
- [ ] Need to hire team faster than revenue allows
- [ ] Specific large opportunity (enterprise contract, expansion)

## Fundraising Stages

**What investors want:**
- Founder-market fit

- Clear differentiation

### Seed ($500K-2M)

**When to raise:** Product-market fit indicators
**What investors want:**
- $10K+ MRR (or clear path)
- 20+ paying customers
- Unit economics that work
- Repeatable acquisition channel

**TeamPulse fit:** Target after $10K MRR milestone

### Not Applicable (For Now)

- Series A ($5-15M) - Need $1M+ ARR
- Later stages - Focus on getting to Seed first

# TeamPulse

**One-liner:** 360-degree performance reviews for small teams at half the price of enterprise tools.

- Goal tracking connected to reviews
- 15-minute setup, not 2-week implementation

## Traction

- 1.5M companies with 10-100 employees in US
- Growing 13% annually

## Business Model
- SaaS subscription ($6-8 per employee/month)

- [X]:1 LTV:CAC

## Team

## Red Flags for Investors

### What Turns Them Off

- [ ] No clear differentiation
- [ ] Small market (<$1B)
- [ ] Poor unit economics
- [ ] No traction (especially at seed)
- [ ] Team can't execute
- [ ] Unclear use of funds
- [ ] Unrealistic projections

### TeamPulse Risks to Address

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Crowded market | Clear positioning (SMB + gap analysis) |
| Enterprise downmarket | Speed to market, customer relationships |
| Single founder | Can do a lot with low burn |
| No revenue yet | Expected at this stage |

---

## Recommendation for TeamPulse

### Current Recommendation: Bootstrap

**Reasons:**
1. Low burn rate possible (~$200-400/month)
2. Can reach profitability with 25-30 customers
3. Unit economics should be strong (high margin, low CAC)
4. Market isn't winner-take-all
5. Raising too early dilutes unnecessarily

### When to Reconsider Raising

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| $10K MRR with 25% MoM growth | Consider pre-seed |
| Competitor raises significant round | Evaluate acceleration |
| Enterprise opportunity requiring sales team | Consider seed |
| Proven unit economics, want to go faster | Consider seed |

### 6-Month Focus

**Months 1-3:** Build, launch, get first customers
**Months 4-6:** Prove unit economics, grow to $3-5K MRR
**Month 6+:** Evaluate: Bootstrap to profitability OR raise to accelerate
