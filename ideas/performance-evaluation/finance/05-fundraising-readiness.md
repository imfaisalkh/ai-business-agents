# Fundraising Readiness

## Current Stage: Bootstrap

**Recommendation:** Don't raise capital in Year 1. Bootstrap to $100K ARR, then decide.

**Why bootstrap first:**
- Low burn ($82/month out-of-pocket)
- Fast path to profitability (Month 3-4 cash flow positive)
- Retain 100% equity
- Learn sales/product without VC pressure

## When to Consider Fundraising

### Fundraise IF (And Only IF):
1. **Hit $100K ARR** → Proven product-market fit
2. **NRR >110%** → Strong retention + expansion
3. **CAC payback <6 months** → Efficient acquisition
4. **Clear growth bottleneck** → Need capital to hire or scale ads
5. **Competitive threat** → Need to move faster than bootstrapped pace allows

### DON'T Fundraise If:
- ARR <$50K (too early, dilute equity for nothing)
- Churn >7%/month (fix product first)
- Unclear why you need capital (VCs will ask "why not bootstrap?")

## Pre-Seed Fundraising Scenario (If Needed)

### Raise: $500K-$1M Pre-Seed
**Valuation:** $4-6M post-money (8-12% dilution)

**Use of funds:**
- **$200K:** Founder salary (2 years runway)
- **$150K:** Hire 1 engineer (accelerate product)
- **$100K:** Marketing/ads (scale acquisition)
- **$50K:** Tools, hosting, ops

**18-month milestones:**
- $500K ARR (from $100K)
- 50-70 customers
- 2-3 person team
- Ready for Seed round ($1.5-3M)

## Fundraising Materials (If/When Ready)

### 1. Pitch Deck (10-12 slides)
1. **Problem:** Reviews are manual chaos OR $2K/year enterprise tools
2. **Solution:** Performance reviews with gap analysis at $6-8 PEPM
3. **Traction:** $100K ARR, 70 customers, 25% trial-to-paid, <5% churn
4. **Market:** $2.5B performance management market, 600K target companies
5. **Product:** Screenshots of gap analysis (differentiator), peer feedback
6. **Business Model:** SaaS, $6-8 PEPM, 85% gross margin, $120 ARPA
7. **Go-to-Market:** LinkedIn outreach, founder-led sales, 7-14 day cycle
8. **Competition:** Lattice ($11-16), 15Five ($8-12), vs us ($6-8) with same core features
9. **Team:** Founder background (domain expertise, technical chops)
10. **Ask:** $500K pre-seed, 18-month runway to $500K ARR

### 2. Financial Model (3-Year Projections)
- Year 1: $100K ARR (bootstrapped)
- Year 2: $500K ARR (post-fundraise)
- Year 3: $2M ARR (Series A-ready)

### 3. Metrics Snapshot
- MRR growth rate: 15-20%/month
- CAC: $500
- LTV: $3,400
- LTV:CAC: 6.8x
- Churn: 3%/month
- NRR: 110%

## Bootstrap Exit Strategy (Alternative to VC)

### Option 1: Lifestyle Business
- Reach $500K-1M ARR
- 2-5 person team
- 60-80% profit margin
- $300K-600K/year founder salary
- **Exit:** Never (run profitably forever)

### Option 2: Acquisition
- Reach $1-3M ARR
- Acquired by Lattice, BambooHR, or Rippling
- **Valuation:** 4-8x ARR = $4-24M exit
- **Timeline:** 3-5 years

### Option 3: Raise Later
- Bootstrap to $500K-1M ARR
- Raise Series A ($3-5M) at $20-30M valuation
- Scale to $10M+ ARR
- **Exit:** $100M+ acquisition or IPO
