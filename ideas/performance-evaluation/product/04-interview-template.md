## Interview Script (30 minutes)

### Intro (2 min)

> "Thanks for taking the time, [Name]. I'm working on a performance review tool for small teams and trying to understand how managers like you handle reviews today. There are no wrong answers - I'm just trying to learn about your world. Mind if I take notes?"

**Rapport building:**
- "How long have you been managing at [Company]?"
- "How many people on your team?"

---

### Part 1: Current State & Problem (10 min)

*Using Unified Customer Conversation Framework*

**1. Current Process:**
> "Walk me through the last time you ran performance reviews. What did that process look like, start to finish?"

*Listen for:*
- [ ] Tools mentioned (Google Docs, spreadsheets, existing software)
- [ ] Time spent (hours per review, total cycle time)
- [ ] Frustrations voiced (unprompted complaints)
- [ ] Who else was involved (HR, employees)
- [ ] Frequency (annual, quarterly, ad-hoc)

**Follow-up probes:**
- "What tool did you use to write the reviews?"
- "How did employees see their feedback?"
- "How long did each review take you?"
- "What happened when the cycle was over?"

**2. Pain Quantification:**
> "How much time does review season cost you? And what happens when reviews don't go well or don't happen at all?"

*Listen for:*
- [ ] Specific hours/days mentioned
- [ ] Downstream impacts (retention, legal, morale)
- [ ] Emotional language ("dread," "chaos," "nightmare")

**Follow-up probes:**
- "What's the cost of NOT doing reviews?"
- "Have you ever had issues because feedback wasn't documented?"
- "How do your team members feel about the current process?"

**3. Failed Solutions:**
> "What have you tried to solve this? Other tools, templates, different approaches?"

*Listen for:*
- [ ] Past purchases (what tools, why abandoned)
- [ ] Price points they've considered
- [ ] Feature gaps that drove them away
- [ ] "Good enough" vs. "actively looking"

**Follow-up probes:**
- "What made you stop using [previous solution]?"
- "What was missing from that tool?"
- "How much did you pay for it?"

**4. Trigger Events:**
> "When did performance reviews become a problem you wanted to solve? What triggered that?"

*Listen for:*
- [ ] Team growth (passed 10 people)
- [ ] Bad experience (lost documentation, retention issue)
- [ ] External pressure (investors, board, legal)
- [ ] Employee feedback (complaints about no feedback)

### Part 2: Feature Prioritization (8 min)

**5. Feature Ranking Exercise:**
> "I'm going to list 5 features. Please rank them 1-5 based on what would make the biggest difference for you, with 1 being most important."

| Feature | Description | Rank |
|---------|-------------|------|
| Employee Self-Review | Employees rate themselves on same criteria as manager | |
| Gap Analysis | See side-by-side comparison of self vs manager ratings | |
| Peer Feedback (360) | Anonymous feedback from colleagues | |
| Goal Tracking | Set and track goals, reference in reviews | |
| Pre-built Templates | Ready-to-use templates for different roles | |

**Follow-up:**
- "Why did you rank [#1] highest?"
- "What would you do with the gap analysis information?"
- "How important is anonymity for peer feedback?"

**6. Missing Features:**
> "Is there anything you absolutely need that I didn't mention?"

*Listen for:*
- [ ] Integrations (HRIS, Slack)
- [ ] Reporting/analytics
- [ ] Calibration (large team feature)
- [ ] 1:1 meeting tools

---

### Part 3: Solution Validation (5 min)

**7. Concept Reaction:**
> "Let me describe what I'm building: TeamPulse is a performance review tool where employees complete self-reviews on the same criteria as their manager, then you see a side-by-side comparison highlighting where your ratings differ - so your review meeting becomes a focused coaching conversation instead of a monologue. Peer feedback is collected anonymously and aggregated. Setup takes 15 minutes, not 2 weeks, and it costs about half what Lattice charges. What's your initial reaction?"

*Listen for:*
- [ ] "That's exactly what I need" (strong positive)
- [ ] "Interesting, but..." (conditional interest)
- [ ] Specific questions about features (engaged)
- [ ] "We're fine with what we have" (not a fit)

**8. Gap Analysis Deep Dive:**
> "The gap analysis shows you where you rated someone a 3 on communication but they rated themselves a 5. What would you do with that information?"

*Listen for:*
- [ ] "That would make my 1:1s so much better" (high value)
- [ ] "I'm not sure" (may not understand value)
- [ ] Specific use cases mentioned

---

### Part 4: Pricing & Buying (5 min)

**9. Pricing Reaction:**
> "A tool like this would cost about $6-8 per employee per month. For a team of [their size], that's about $[X] per month. How does that feel?"

*Listen for:*
- [ ] "That's reasonable" (positive)
- [ ] "That's cheaper than I expected" (very positive)
- [ ] "That's more than I want to spend" (objection - probe further)
- [ ] Comparison to other tools/budgets

**Follow-up probes:**
- "What do you compare that to?"
- "What's your budget for HR/people tools?"
- "Who would need to approve this purchase?"

**10. Decision Process:**
> "If you found a solution that solved this, what would the process be to get it implemented at [Company]?"

*Listen for:*
- [ ] "I can decide" (fast sales cycle)
- [ ] "I'd need to talk to [person]" (stakeholder mapping)
- [ ] Budget approval process
- [ ] Timeline considerations

**11. Timeline:**
> "When's your next review cycle?"
> "What would need to happen for you to have a tool in place before then?"

---

### Wrap Up (2 min)

**12. Open Ended:**
> "Is there anything I should have asked but didn't? Anything else you want to share about how you think about performance reviews?"

**13. Referrals:**
> "Do you know other managers who deal with the same challenges? Would you be comfortable making an introduction?"

**14. Next Steps:**
> "Thanks so much for your time. Would you be interested in being one of our early beta users when we launch? I can give you early access at a discount."
