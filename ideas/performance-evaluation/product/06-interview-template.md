## Interview Tips

### Do's

- **Listen more than you talk** (80/20 rule)
- **Ask "why" repeatedly** to dig deeper
- **Use silence** - let them fill the gap
- **Take verbatim notes** - their words, not your interpretation
- **Ask for stories** - "Tell me about a time when..."
- **Stay neutral** - don't defend your idea

### Don'ts

- **Don't pitch** - you're learning, not selling
- **Don't lead** - "Wouldn't it be great if..." is bad
- **Don't ask about the future** - "Would you use X?" is unreliable
- **Don't interrupt** - let them finish thoughts
- **Don't take feature requests at face value** - ask why they want it

### Good vs. Bad Questions

| Bad Question | Why Bad | Good Alternative |
|--------------|---------|------------------|
| "Would you use a feature that..." | Hypothetical, people lie | "Tell me about the last time you needed..." |
| "Don't you hate spreadsheets?" | Leading | "What's your experience with spreadsheets for reviews?" |
| "This feature is great, right?" | Leading | "What do you think of this feature?" |
| "Would you pay $7/month?" | Yes is meaningless | "What would you stop using to afford this?" |
