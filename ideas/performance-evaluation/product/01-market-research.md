## Feature Adoption Analysis (80/20 Rule)

*Identify which features are used by most users vs. power users only*

### High-Adoption Features (Must Build - 80%+ users)

| Feature | Why High Adoption | Competitor Coverage | Our Priority |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Manager reviews | Core use case - why they buy | All have it | P0 |
| Employee self-review | Expected in modern reviews | Most have it | P0 |
| Peer feedback | 360 is table stakes now | Most have it | P0 |
| Pre-built templates | Nobody wants to start from scratch | All have it | P0 |
| Review reminders | Critical for completion rates | All have it | P0 |
| Review history | Managers need to reference past reviews | All have it | P0 |

### Medium-Adoption Features (Should Build - 40-80% users)

| Feature | User Segment | Competitor Coverage | Our Priority |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Gap analysis (self vs manager) | Coaching-focused managers | Lattice, Leapsome partial | P0 (Wow feature) |
| Goal setting | Growth-focused teams | All have some version | P0 |
| Anonymous aggregation | Teams wanting honest feedback | Enterprise tools | P0 |
| Team analytics | HR and senior managers | All have varying depth | P1 |
| Export/reporting | HR for compliance | All have it | P1 |

### Low-Adoption Features (Skip for Now - <40% users in SMBs)

| Feature | Why Low Adoption | Skip Reason |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| Weekly check-ins | Separate workflow from reviews | Only 15Five focuses here |
| OKR platform | Companies use dedicated tools | Notion, Monday, dedicated OKR tools |
| Engagement surveys | Separate buying decision | Not core to reviews |
| 1:1 meeting tools | Many use Notion/docs | Not core to reviews |
| HRIS integrations | Most SMBs manually manage | V2 feature |
| SSO/SAML | Enterprise requirement | Not needed for 10-50 employee target |
| Calibration | Large team coordination | <50 employees don't calibrate |
| Learning paths | Separate platform | Very few competitors offer |

**Key Insight:** To compete with non-enterprise players, we MUST have: manager reviews, self-reviews, peer feedback with anonymous aggregation, goal setting, templates, and reminders. Gap analysis is our "wow" feature that differentiates from Small Improvements.

---

## Strategic Opportunities

### 1. Underserved Segment

**Who:** Engineering managers and HR leads at 10-50 person companies
**Why underserved:**
- Too small for Lattice/15Five (pricing and minimums)
- Small Improvements lacks key features (gap analysis, proper 360)
- Stuck using Google Docs or skipping reviews entirely
**Our play:** Enterprise review features (gap analysis, 360) at SMB-friendly pricing ($6-8 PEPM)

### 2. Feature Gap

**Missing in market:** Self-review with manager-vs-employee gap analysis at SMB pricing
**Validation needed:** Discovery calls confirm gap analysis is highly valued
**Effort estimate:** 2-3 weeks additional dev vs basic self-review
**Impact:** Primary differentiator - "See exactly where your ratings differ from your employees"

### 3. Positioning Angle

**Untaken position:** "Lattice features. Spreadsheet pricing."
**Why credible for us:** We're not building OKRs, engagement surveys, or enterprise features - just reviews done right
**Messaging:** "The 360-review tool for teams that outgrew spreadsheets but aren't ready for enterprise pricing"

---

## Key Insights

**Top 3 things we learned:**

1. **Gap analysis is the differentiator:** Small Improvements (main SMB competitor) doesn't show self vs manager comparison. This is our "wow" feature that justifies premium over basic tools.

2. **Enterprise tools are over-built for SMBs:** Lattice/15Five include OKRs, engagement, weekly check-ins - features that small teams don't use. We can win by doing reviews really well and skipping the rest.

3. **Pricing gap is real:** $5 (basic) vs $11+ (enterprise) leaves room for $6-8 "enterprise features, startup pricing" positioning.

**Biggest risk:**
Lattice or 15Five launch "lite" tier for SMBs, competing directly with our positioning. Mitigation: Move fast, build brand loyalty, focus on UX that enterprise tools can't match.

**Biggest opportunity:**
Gap analysis as headline feature could make us the "Figma of performance reviews" - the tool designers and engineers specifically want because it's built for coaching conversations, not HR compliance.
