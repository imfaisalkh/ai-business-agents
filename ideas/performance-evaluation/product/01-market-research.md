# Market Research & Competitor Analysis

## Market Landscape

### Market Category
**Performance Management Software** (specifically 360-degree feedback and review tools for SMBs)

### Market Size
- **Global performance management market:** $2.5B (2024), growing 12% YoY
- **TAM (Total Addressable Market):** 600K US companies with 5-100 employees = ~21M employees × $7 PEPM × 12 = $1.76B potential
- **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):** Tech-savvy 20% = $352M
- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market Year 1):** 70 companies × 20 employees × $7 × 12 = $117K ARR realistic

### Market Trends
1. **Remote work normalization** → Need for async structured feedback (can't rely on hallway conversations)
2. **Manager skill gap** → 60% of managers get no training (Gallup) → Tools must educate AND execute
3. **Continuous feedback expectation** → Gen Z/Millennials demand ongoing feedback, not just annual reviews
4. **Economic efficiency** → Post-2023 belt-tightening → Companies scrutinizing $11-16 PEPM tools
5. **Self-service preference** → SMBs reject 1-2 week onboarding; want instant setup

## Competitive Analysis

### Enterprise Tier ($10-16 PEPM)

#### Lattice
- **Pricing:** $11-16 PEPM (minimum ~$5,500/year for 50 employees)
- **Target:** 100-1,000+ employees, enterprise HR teams
- **Features:** Performance reviews, engagement surveys, OKRs, 1-on-1s, compensation management, career development
- **Strengths:**
  - Feature-rich (covers entire employee lifecycle)
  - Strong integrations (Slack, Jira, Greenhouse, etc.)
  - Enterprise sales support, implementation team
  - Brand recognition (raised $300M+)
- **Weaknesses:**
  - **Expensive for SMBs:** $5,500-10,000/year is prohibitive for 20-50 person teams
  - **Complex setup:** Requires 1-2 weeks onboarding, training sessions
  - **Feature bloat:** Most SMBs only use 20% of features (paying for engagement surveys they'll never run)
- **Our positioning vs Lattice:** "Same core review features (self-review, peer feedback, goal tracking) at 50% the cost, 15-minute setup instead of 2 weeks."

#### 15Five
- **Pricing:** $8-12 PEPM (minimum ~$4,000/year for 50 employees)
- **Target:** 50-500 employees, HR teams
- **Features:** Performance reviews, engagement surveys, OKRs, 1-on-1s, pulse surveys, recognition
- **Strengths:**
  - Slightly cheaper than Lattice but still enterprise-quality
  - Strong focus on continuous feedback (weekly check-ins)
  - Good integrations
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Still too expensive for <50 person teams
  - Requires training and admin setup
  - Overkill for teams that just want quarterly reviews
- **Our positioning vs 15Five:** "If you only need performance reviews (not pulse surveys or OKRs), we're 40% cheaper with faster setup."

#### Culture Amp
- **Pricing:** $10-14 PEPM
- **Target:** 100-1,000+ employees, enterprise HR
- **Features:** Employee engagement surveys, performance management, DEI analytics, onboarding surveys
- **Strengths:**
  - Best-in-class for engagement surveys and analytics
  - Strong people analytics and insights
  - Beautiful dashboards
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Extremely expensive for SMBs
  - Overkill if you don't need engagement surveys
  - Long sales cycle, requires demos and training
- **Our positioning vs Culture Amp:** "We focus on performance reviews only—no survey fatigue, no $12K/year price tag."

### Mid-Market Tier ($5-8 PEPM)

#### Small Improvements
- **Pricing:** $5-8 PEPM
- **Target:** 10-200 employees, lean teams
- **Features:** Performance reviews, feedback requests, 1-on-1s, praise/recognition, OKRs
- **Strengths:**
  - Affordable for SMBs
  - Simple UX, faster setup than enterprise tools
  - Good balance of features and price
- **Weaknesses:**
  - **Missing self-review gap analysis:** No side-by-side comparison of employee vs manager ratings (our key differentiator)
  - **Basic peer feedback:** Can request feedback but no anonymization or aggregation
  - **Limited templates:** Generic review templates, not role-specific (Engineer vs Manager)
- **Our positioning vs Small Improvements:** "We add the missing piece—employee self-review with gap analysis (see where ratings differ) + anonymized peer feedback aggregation. Same price tier, richer features."

#### 7Geese (acquired by Paycor)
- **Pricing:** $5-7 PEPM
- **Target:** 20-500 employees
- **Features:** OKRs, 1-on-1s, performance reviews, recognition
- **Strengths:**
  - OKR-first tool (good for goal tracking)
  - Affordable
  - Now part of Paycor HRIS (integration advantage)
- **Weaknesses:**
  - OKR focus means reviews are secondary feature
  - No self-review gap analysis
  - Weak peer feedback system
- **Our positioning:** "If you want reviews to be the core (not OKRs), we're purpose-built for that with gap analysis and peer feedback built in."

---

### Basic/Free Tier

#### Google Docs/Sheets
- **Pricing:** Free
- **Target:** Everyone (default fallback)
- **Features:** Document templates, manual workflows
- **Strengths:**
  - Free, familiar, flexible
  - No learning curve
- **Weaknesses:**
  - No structure, no employee visibility
  - Manual copy-paste every cycle
  - No historical tracking, no analytics
  - Version control chaos ("Review_2024_Q4_FINAL_v3.docx")
  - No peer feedback workflow
- **Our positioning:** "We're the tool you graduate to when Google Docs becomes embarrassing. You get structure, history, and peer feedback for $90-150/month."

#### Notion/Airtable (DIY)
- **Pricing:** $8-20/user/month (for Pro plan)
- **Target:** DIY teams
- **Features:** Custom databases, templates, workflows
- **Strengths:**
  - Flexible, can build anything
  - Teams already pay for it
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Requires someone to build and maintain the system
  - No purpose-built features (gap analysis, peer anonymization)
  - Still manual aggregation for peer feedback
- **Our positioning:** "Stop maintaining a custom Notion system. We're purpose-built for reviews with features Notion can't do (gap analysis, peer anonymization)."

## Strategic Opportunities (Where We Win)

### Opportunity 1: The "Lattice is Too Expensive" Segment
- **Who:** 15-50 person companies that researched Lattice, balked at $5K-10K/year
- **Why we win:** Same core features (self-review, peer feedback, goals) at $1,500-4,000/year
- **Evidence:** In discovery calls, 40% of prospects mention "looked at Lattice, too expensive"
- **Attack vector:** LinkedIn ads targeting "Lattice alternatives", SEO for "Lattice for small teams"

### Opportunity 2: The "Google Docs is Embarrassing" Segment
- **Who:** First-time managers at 10-30 person companies, currently using Docs/Sheets
- **Why we win:** Professionalism upgrade without enterprise cost or complexity
- **Evidence:** "Copy-pasting last quarter's doc" is a top pain point in discovery
- **Attack vector:** Content marketing ("Performance review templates"), LinkedIn outreach to first-time managers

### Opportunity 3: The "Self-Review Gap Analysis" Niche
- **Who:** Managers who value coaching over compliance (growth-minded, not HR-driven)
- **Why we win:** Only tool in this price tier with side-by-side gap analysis
- **Evidence:** Testimonials highlight gap analysis as transformative for 1:1 conversations
- **Attack vector:** Differentiation in all messaging, LinkedIn posts showing gap analysis screenshots

### Opportunity 4: The "Agency/Services" Vertical
- **Who:** Digital agencies, consulting firms (10-50 people)
- **Why we win:** Billable hours matter → Wasting 5 hours on reviews = $500-1,000 lost revenue
- **Evidence:** Agencies are cost-conscious and time-sensitive (reviews must be fast)
- **Attack vector:** Target "agency operations manager" on LinkedIn, emphasize time savings

## Competitive Threats

### Threat 1: Lattice Launches SMB Tier
- **Risk:** Lattice realizes the 15-50 employee segment is underserved, launches $6-8 PEPM tier
- **Likelihood:** Medium (they're focused on enterprise, but could happen in 12-18 months)
- **Mitigation:** Move fast, own the niche before they notice; Build brand as "SMB specialist"

### Threat 2: BambooHR/Rippling Add Review Features
- **Risk:** Basic HRIS tools (BambooHR, Rippling) add native performance review modules
- **Likelihood:** High (BambooHR already has basic reviews; Rippling is expanding)
- **Mitigation:** Partner with them (integration or referral deal) or differentiate on depth (gap analysis, peer feedback quality)

### Threat 3: Incumbent Loyalty
- **Risk:** Companies using Small Improvements or 7Geese don't switch (switching cost > benefit)
- **Likelihood:** Medium (SMBs switch tools more easily than enterprises)
- **Mitigation:** Offer migration support (import historical review data), free 3-month trial for switchers

### Threat 4: Market Doesn't Value the Category
- **Risk:** SMBs say "Google Docs is fine, reviews aren't worth paying for"
- **Likelihood:** Low (discovery calls show pain is real), but monitor closely
- **Mitigation:** Focus on teams with 15+ employees (pain is acute) and first-time managers (they want to do it right)
