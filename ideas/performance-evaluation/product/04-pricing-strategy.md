## Pricing Rationale

### Value-Based Pricing Calculation

**Time savings:**
- Managers save 30 min per review (gap analysis + automation)
- 10-person team = 10 reviews/quarter = 5 hours saved/quarter = 20 hours/year
- Manager hourly rate: $50-100/hour
- **Value created:** $1,000-2,000/year

**Cost of current alternatives:**
- Lattice: $11-16 PEPM × 10 employees × 12 months = $1,320-1,920/year
- Our price: $6-7 PEPM × 10 employees × 12 months = $720-840/year
- **Savings:** $600-1,080/year (45-56% cheaper)

**ROI for customer:**
- Pay $720/year, save 20 hours ($1,000-2,000 value) + avoid Lattice cost ($1,320)
- **Net ROI:** $1,600-2,600/year
- **Payback period:** <1 month

## Pricing Experiments (Validate in Beta)

### Experiment 1: $6 vs $7 PEPM (Starter Plan)
- **Hypothesis:** $6 converts better (lower friction) but $7 is still 50% cheaper than Lattice
- **Test:** Show $6 to first 25 trials, $7 to next 25 trials
- **Measure:** Trial-to-paid conversion rate (target: >25%)
- **Decision:** If $7 converts >20%, go with $7 (higher revenue, still competitive)

### Experiment 2: Show Pricing on Landing Page vs "Contact Sales"
- **Hypothesis:** Transparent pricing increases trust and conversion
- **Test:** A/B test landing page (Pricing visible vs "Book Demo to see pricing")
- **Measure:** Demo booking rate, trial signup rate
- **Decision:** If transparent pricing increases signups >15%, keep it visible

### Experiment 3: Free Trial Length (14 days vs 30 days)
- **Hypothesis:** 14 days is enough to run one review cycle (most cycles are <2 weeks)
- **Test:** First 50 trials get 14 days, next 50 get 30 days
- **Measure:** Trial-to-paid conversion (target: >25%)
- **Decision:** If 14 days converts >25%, stick with it (faster sales cycle)

## Pricing FAQs (For Sales Enablement)

**Q: "Why not just use Google Docs for free?"**
A: Google Docs works until you have 10+ employees. Then you're copy-pasting docs, losing review history, manually aggregating peer feedback. We save you 30 min per review = 20 hours/year for a 10-person team. That's $1,000-2,000 value for $720/year.

**Q: "How is this different from Lattice at $11-16 PEPM?"**
A: We focus on the 20% of features that drive 80% of value (self-review, gap analysis, peer feedback, goal tracking). Lattice adds engagement surveys, OKRs, compensation management—features most SMBs don't use. We're 50% cheaper because we don't charge for bloat.

**Q: "What if we only need to run reviews twice a year (semi-annual)?"**
A: Our pricing is annual (you pay for the year, use it as often as you want). If you run reviews twice a year, that's $720/year ÷ 2 cycles = $360 per cycle for a 10-person team. Still cheaper than hiring a consultant or wasting 10+ hours on manual process.

**Q: "Can we pay per review cycle instead of monthly?"**
A: Not yet. PEPM is industry standard and allows us to invest in continuous improvements (we ship features between your review cycles). Annual billing gives you 15% discount if cash flow is a concern.

**Q: "Do managers count as users?"**
A: Yes, if they're receiving reviews from their manager. If they only give reviews (e.g., CEO who doesn't get reviewed), they don't count.
