# Pricing Strategy

*Generated for: Performance Evaluation Tool*

## Pricing Model

### Selected Model: Per-Employee-Per-Month (PEPM)

**Why PEPM:**
1. Industry standard for HR/performance tools
2. Scales naturally with customer growth (built-in expansion revenue)
3. Easy to compare with competitors
4. Predictable for customers (know cost before trial)

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Model | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|-------|------|------|---------|
| Flat monthly fee | Simple, predictable | Doesn't scale with value | Too simple |
| Per-manager | Aligns with buyers | Small teams = tiny revenue | Underprices value |
| Per-review-cycle | Usage-based fairness | Unpredictable revenue | Too complex |
| **Per-employee** | **Industry standard, scales** | **Requires employee tracking** | **Winner** |

## Price Points

### Core Pricing

| Plan | Monthly | Annual (per month) | Annual Discount |
|------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Standard** | $8/employee | $7/employee | 12.5% |
| **Early Adopter** | $7/employee | $6/employee | 14% |
| **Founding Member** | $6/employee | $5/employee | 17% |

### Minimum Team Size

## Pricing Psychology

### Anchoring Strategy

**Present pricing like this:**

```
"Lattice costs $11-16 per employee. We're $7-8."
"That's 40-50% less for the same core features."
"For a 25-person team: $2,100/year vs $3,300-4,800."
```

### Price Framing

| Frame | Message |
|-------|---------|
| Per employee | "$7/employee/month" |
| Per team (25 ppl) | "$175/month for your team" |
| Per year | "$2,100/year" (sounds cheaper than monthly x 12) |
| Per review cycle | "$43 per review cycle" (quarterly) |
| Per hour saved | "Saves 30 min/review = pays for itself in 1 review" |

### Decoy Effect

Don't offer multiple plans, but do offer:
- Monthly vs Annual (annual looks like great deal)
- Standard vs Early Adopter pricing (urgency)
