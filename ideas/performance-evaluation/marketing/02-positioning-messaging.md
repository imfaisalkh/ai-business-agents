## Positioning Statement

### The Formula

**For** [small team managers (15-50 employees)]
**Who** [need structured performance evaluations but can't afford enterprise tools]
**Our product is** [an affordable 360-degree performance management platform]
**That** [provides self-review, peer feedback, and goal tracking at half the cost of Lattice]
**Unlike** [spreadsheets that lack structure or enterprise tools that cost $11+ per employee]
**We** [deliver enterprise-grade features at SMB pricing with zero setup complexity]

### One-Liner (Elevator Pitch)

### Tagline Options

1. **Primary:** "Enterprise reviews. Startup pricing."
2. **Alternative:** "360-degree reviews without the enterprise price tag"
3. **Action-focused:** "Run your first structured review cycle in 15 minutes"

## ICP-Specific Messaging

### For Engineering Managers

**Pain:** "I want to give good feedback but I don't have time to manage spreadsheets and forms"

**Hook:** "Run engineering performance reviews in 15 minutes - not 15 hours"

**Message:**
> Your engineers deserve structured feedback. But managing Google Docs, chasing peer reviews, and comparing self-assessments shouldn't take a full day per person. Our platform automates the busywork so you can focus on the conversations that matter.

**Features to emphasize:**
- Technical competency templates (Junior/Mid/Senior Engineer)
- Peer review automation with anonymization
- Gap analysis for coaching conversations

### For HR Generalists / People Ops

**Pain:** "I'm the only HR person and I need tools that just work"

**Hook:** "Finally, performance reviews you can set up in an afternoon - not a quarter"

**Message:**
> You're handling recruiting, benefits, compliance, AND performance. You don't have time to implement a complex system. Our platform gives you pre-built templates, automatic reminders, and a full audit trail - without the enterprise setup nightmare.

**Features to emphasize:**
- Pre-built role templates (plug and play)
- Automatic reminder system
- Compliance-ready documentation and audit trail

### For Startup Founders/CEOs

**Pain:** "I know we need better processes but I'm not paying enterprise prices"

**Hook:** "Give your team Lattice-quality reviews without the Lattice budget"

**Message:**
> Your team outgrew informal feedback. But at 25 employees, you shouldn't pay $3,300/year for performance software. Get the features that matter - self-reviews, peer feedback, goal tracking - at half the price. Your employees get better feedback, you get documented processes, and finance stays happy.

**Features to emphasize:**
- ROI: 40-50% savings vs enterprise tools
- Legal protection from documented performance history
- Team analytics for company-wide visibility

## Objection Handling (Messaging)

### "Spreadsheets work fine for us"

**Reframe:** "Spreadsheets work until they don't. When you need to fire someone and have no documentation, or a good employee leaves citing 'lack of feedback,' spreadsheets become a liability."

**Follow-up:** "What happens when you need to reference what you discussed with someone 3 quarters ago?"

### "We'll just use Lattice/15Five"

**Reframe:** "For a 25-person team, Lattice costs $3,300-4,800/year. We're $1,800-2,400. You get the same core features - self-review, peer feedback, goals - without paying for enterprise features you'll never use."

**Follow-up:** "What features are worth paying 2x for?"

### "Our team is too small for formal reviews"

**Reframe:** "At 15 employees, informal feedback becomes impossible. You can't remember conversations from 3 months ago. Your employees feel like they're not getting feedback. And if you need to let someone go, you have no documentation."

**Follow-up:** "How do you handle it when an employee asks why they didn't get a raise?"

### "We don't have budget for another tool"

**Reframe:** "The average manager spends 5 hours per quarter on manual review processes. At $100/hour loaded cost, that's $500/quarter = $2,000/year. Our tool costs $1,200-1,800/year and saves that time."

**Follow-up:** "What's your time worth?"

### Against Small Improvements / Basic Tools

> "You need more than basic reviews. Self-assessments, peer feedback, gap analysis - features basic tools don't have. But you shouldn't have to pay enterprise prices to get them."
