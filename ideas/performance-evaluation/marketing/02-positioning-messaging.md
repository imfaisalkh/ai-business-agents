# Positioning & Messaging Framework

## Positioning Statement
For first-time engineering and product managers in 15-50 person companies who struggle with inconsistent, undocumented performance reviews, TeamPulse is a 360-degree evaluation platform that enables structured self-review, peer feedback, and goal tracking in one place. Unlike Lattice at $11-16 PEPM or Google Docs chaos, we deliver enterprise-quality reviews at $6-8 PEPM with zero setup time.

## One-Liner Variations

**Problem-focused:**
"Stop copying last quarter's review docs. Run structured 360-degree performance reviews with self-review, peer feedback, and goal tracking—without the $2K/month enterprise price tag."

**Outcome-focused:**
"Give your team consistent, documented feedback with employee self-review and peer insights—all at 50% the cost of Lattice."

**Curiosity hook:**
"What if performance reviews actually helped your team grow instead of checking a compliance box?"

## Core Messages (Pick 3)

### Message 1: Enterprise Features Without Enterprise Pricing
- **Headline:** "360-degree reviews shouldn't cost $2,000/month for a 20-person team"
- **Supporting point:** Lattice charges $11-16 PEPM ($2,640-3,840/year for 20 people). You get the same features—self-review with gap analysis, peer feedback, goal tracking—for $6-8 PEPM ($1,440-1,920/year). That's $1,200-2,400 saved annually.
- **Proof point:** "We built this because we couldn't justify Lattice's pricing for our 15-person team. Now we use our own product and save $1,800/year."

### Message 2: Self-Review Gap Analysis (The Differentiator)
- **Headline:** "See where your ratings differ from your team's self-ratings—before the review conversation"
- **Supporting point:** The most valuable coaching moments happen when you see the gap: employee rates themselves 3/5 on "Code Quality," you rated them 5/5. That's a confidence issue, not a skill issue. Our side-by-side comparison makes this visible before you meet, so you coach instead of surprise.
- **Proof point:** "My best 1:1 ever was when I saw my engineer rated themselves 2/5 on 'Impact' but I had them at 5/5. Turned into a 30-minute conversation about imposter syndrome. Without the gap view, I wouldn't have known." - Engineering Manager, 30-person startup

### Message 3: Launch in 15 Minutes, Not 2 Weeks
- **Headline:** "Pre-built templates for Engineers, Managers, and Sales Reps (Junior/Mid/Senior levels)—just add your team"
- **Supporting point:** Enterprise tools require implementation consultants, training sessions, and 1-2 weeks of admin setup. You import your team from Slack/CSV, pick role-based templates, and send your first review in 15 minutes. No training needed.
- **Proof point:** "We started our Q1 reviews the same day we signed up. Imported 12 people from Slack, picked the 'Mid-Level Engineer' template, and sent self-reviews by lunch." - Product Manager, digital agency

## Voice & Tone

**We sound like:**
- A senior manager mentoring a first-time manager over coffee
- Confident but not arrogant (we've been there)
- Data-informed but not robotic (we prioritize outcomes over features)
- Pragmatic and time-conscious (bootstrap mindset)

**We never sound like:**
- HR consultants with corporate jargon ("synergize performance alignment")
- Sales-y or hype-driven ("Revolutionary! Game-changing!")
- Academic or theoretical ("Research shows that 360-degree feedback correlates with...")
- Dismissive of spreadsheets (we respect the hustle, just offer a better way)

**Example phrases we use:**
- "Run reviews that actually help your team grow"
- "Stop copy-pasting last quarter's Google Doc"
- "Side-by-side gap analysis" (our feature differentiator)
- "15 minutes to launch" (speed to value)
- "Built for teams of 15-50, priced like it"

**Words we avoid:**
- "Synergy," "leverage," "360-degree feedback ecosystem" (corporate speak)
- "Revolutionary," "industry-leading," "best-in-class" (unsubstantiated hype)
- "Utilize," "facilitate," "optimize" (use simple verbs: use, help, improve)
- "Solution," "platform" (when "tool" or "product" is clearer)

## Objection Pre-Handlers

| Objection | Response Theme |
|-----------|----------------|
| "Too expensive—we're bootstrapped" | "We're $6-8 PEPM = $90-150/month for 15 people. That's 1-2 hours of your time saved per review cycle. If you're doing quarterly reviews, that's 8+ hours saved/year = $400-800 value. Plus, poor reviews cost you people (replacement = $50-100K)." |
| "We use Lattice/15Five" | "Great—you value structured reviews. Question: Are you using peer feedback and self-review features? If not, you're paying $11+ PEPM for what we offer at $6-8. If yes, how's the ROI for a <50 person team? We're built specifically for your size." |
| "Not a priority now" | "When's your next review cycle? If it's <90 days out, you'll be copying last quarter's Google Docs again. Take 15 min today to set up templates, save 5+ hours during the cycle. If >90 days out, let's chat 60 days before—sound fair?" |
| "Google Docs works fine" | "Totally—we used Docs too. Question: Can your team see their self-review next to your ratings? Do you have historical review data for promotion decisions? Are peer reviews anonymized and aggregated? If no, those gaps bite you during terminations or promotions." |
| "We're too small for this" | "If you have 5+ direct reports, you're doing 5+ reviews per quarter. That's 20+ hours/year. We save you 30 min per review (gap analysis + templates) = 10+ hours/year. At your hourly rate, that's worth way more than $90/month." |
| "Seems complex to set up" | "15 minutes: Import team from Slack/CSV, pick role templates (Engineer/Manager/Sales), send first self-review. No training, no onboarding calls. If you can use Notion, you can use this." |

## Messaging by Channel

### LinkedIn Posts
- **Tone:** Vulnerable + insightful (share manager challenges)
- **Format:** Story → Insight → Provocative question
- **Example:** "Had a review yesterday where my engineer rated themselves 2/5 on Impact. I had them at 5/5. Spent 30 minutes unpacking imposter syndrome—wouldn't have known without the gap view. How do you spot confidence issues vs skill gaps in your 1:1s?"

### Cold Outreach (LinkedIn DMs)
- **Tone:** Respectful + curious (not pitching immediately)
- **Format:** Context → Value share → Soft question
- **Example:** "Saw you manage an engineering team at [Company]. Just finished Q4 reviews for my team—curious how you handle self-review + peer feedback? We built a tool to stop copy-pasting Google Docs (side-by-side gap analysis has been a game changer). Happy to share what's worked if useful."

### Landing Page
- **Tone:** Confident + practical (you understand their pain)
- **Format:** Problem → Solution → Proof → CTA
- **Example headline:** "Run 360-Degree Performance Reviews Without the $2K/Month Enterprise Price Tag"

### Email Follow-Ups
- **Tone:** Helpful + persistent (not pushy)
- **Format:** Recap → New insight → Clear next step
- **Example:** "Thanks for the call on Tuesday. You mentioned peer feedback is a pain to collect in Docs—we anonymize and aggregate responses automatically. Want to see a 5-min walkthrough of how [similar company] runs their quarterly peer reviews?"
