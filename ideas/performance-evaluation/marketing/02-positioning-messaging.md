# Positioning & Messaging Framework

## Positioning Statement

For **first-time engineering managers and HR leaders at growing startups (10-50 employees)** who **need to run structured performance reviews but find enterprise tools too expensive and complex**, **TeamPulse** is a **performance evaluation platform** that **delivers enterprise-grade features - employee self-review, peer feedback, and gap analysis - at half the price of Lattice**. Unlike **spreadsheets that create chaos or basic tools that skip critical features**, we **give small teams the same powerful review process that top companies use, ready in 15 minutes**.

## One-Liner Variations

- **Problem-focused:** "Stop losing reviews in Google Docs. Run 360-degree evaluations your team will actually complete."

- **Outcome-focused:** "Give your team the feedback process they deserve - without the enterprise price tag."

- **Curiosity hook:** "Why are small teams stuck choosing between $15K/year tools and messy spreadsheets?"

- **Comparison hook:** "Lattice features. Spreadsheet pricing. 15-minute setup."

- **Social proof (post-launch):** "The performance review tool 50+ small teams use to retain their best people."

## Core Messages (Pick 3)

### Message 1: Enterprise Features, Startup Pricing

- **Headline:** Finally, 360-degree reviews your budget can afford
- **Supporting point:** Get employee self-review, peer feedback, and manager-vs-employee gap analysis - the exact features Lattice charges $11+ per employee for - at just $6-8 per employee
- **Proof point:** "We were paying $180/month for Lattice with 15 employees. TeamPulse gives us the same reviews for $90." - [Early customer testimonial]
- **Use when:** Price is the main concern, comparing to enterprise tools

### Message 2: 15-Minute Setup, Zero Admin

- **Headline:** Stop configuring. Start reviewing.
- **Supporting point:** No implementation consultants, no 2-week setup, no manager training required. Add your team, pick a template, launch your review cycle - all in 15 minutes
- **Proof point:** "We set up our first review cycle during a coffee break. Employees started getting invites before I finished my latte." - [Early customer testimonial]
- **Use when:** Buyers burned by complex enterprise tools, time-constrained managers

### Message 3: Reviews Your Employees Actually See

- **Headline:** Give feedback that doesn't disappear into a folder
- **Supporting point:** Employees complete self-reviews, see peer feedback, and compare their ratings against their manager's - driving real coaching conversations, not awkward summary meetings
- **Proof point:** 80%+ self-review completion rate vs. industry average of 60% because employees actually value the process
- **Use when:** Focused on employee experience, retention concerns, manager coaching

## Voice & Tone

### We Sound Like:
- A smart friend who's been through the chaos of review season and figured out a better way
- Confident but not arrogant - we know our stuff but we're not talking down
- Practical and action-oriented - every sentence should move toward doing something
- Slightly irreverent about "enterprise bloat" - we have opinions

### We Never Sound Like:
- Enterprise HR software (no "unlock human capital" or "drive organizational excellence")
- Overly casual/jokey (this is serious business, people's careers are involved)
- Preachy about "the importance of feedback" (our buyers already know)
- Desperate or salesy (no "Act now!" or "Limited time!")

### Example Phrases We Use:
- "Built for teams that ship, not committees that approve"
- "Reviews that actually happen"
- "Your team deserves better than a spreadsheet"
- "See the gap between how employees rate themselves and how you rate them"
- "From zero to first review in 15 minutes"

### Words We Avoid:
- "Robust" (meaningless)
- "Leverage" (corporate speak)
- "Holistic" (vague)
- "Best-in-class" (everyone says it)
- "Synergy" (automatic eye-roll)
- "Human capital" (people aren't capital)

## Objection Pre-Handlers

| Objection | Response Theme |
|-----------|----------------|
| "Too expensive" | "You're paying $[X] for Google Docs chaos. TeamPulse costs less than 1 hour of manager time per month - and saves 30 minutes per review. Do the math: 10 reviews = 5 hours saved = $250+ in manager time." |
| "We use Lattice/15Five" | "Great tools for 100+ employee companies. But you're paying for engagement surveys, OKR platforms, and enterprise integrations you don't use. TeamPulse gives you the reviews features at 50% the cost. Keep Lattice for later - use us now." |
| "We just use spreadsheets" | "Spreadsheets work until they don't. Where's the review from 2 years ago? Can employees see their feedback? Can you compare self-review to manager review? TeamPulse is your upgrade path - familiar simplicity, 10x the power." |
| "Not a priority right now" | "When's your next review cycle? Q1? Most teams start searching 2 weeks before reviews are due and wish they'd started earlier. 15-minute setup means you can be ready tomorrow - no rush, just prepared." |
| "We're too small (under 10)" | "Fair - below 10, you might not need this yet. When you hit 10+ and reviews start feeling chaotic, we'll be here. Can I send you our free manager's guide to running your first reviews?" |
| "We need more features" | "Which ones? We're building for teams exactly like yours. If you need OKRs or engagement surveys, you might want Lattice. If you need clean 360-reviews with self-review, peer feedback, and goal tracking - that's exactly what we do." |
| "Security/compliance concerns" | "Valid concern. SOC 2 Type II in progress, GDPR compliant, data encrypted at rest and in transit, hosted on AWS. We can send our security documentation." |
| "We need integrations" | "What systems? HRIS export (CSV), Slack notifications, and calendar integration for reminders are on the roadmap. We're not trying to replace your HRIS - we're your review layer on top." |

## Competitive Positioning

### vs. Lattice/15Five (Enterprise)
**Their weakness:** Overkill for small teams - complex setup, expensive, features you don't need
**Our angle:** "All the review features, none of the enterprise bloat. Same 360-degree reviews at half the price."

### vs. Small Improvements (Basic)
**Their weakness:** Missing self-review and gap analysis - the features that make reviews actually useful
**Our angle:** "They skip the hard part. We show you exactly where manager and employee ratings differ, so you know what to coach."

### vs. Google Docs/Sheets (DIY)
**Their weakness:** No structure, no employee visibility, no historical tracking, chaos at scale
**Our angle:** "Graduate from spreadsheet chaos. Keep the simplicity, add the structure your team needs."

### vs. Doing Nothing
**Their weakness:** Legal risk, inconsistent feedback, retention problems, no documentation for promotions
**Our angle:** "The cost of no reviews: surprise resignations, wrongful termination exposure, 'why didn't I get promoted' conversations with no data. TeamPulse pays for itself with one avoided bad hire or one retained employee."
