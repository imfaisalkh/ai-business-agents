# Marketing Metrics Dashboard

## North Star Metric

**Qualified Leads per Week:** 0 → 3-5 by Week 8

**Definition of a Qualified Lead:**
A qualified lead is a manager who:
1. **Matches ICP:** Engineering/Product/Operations Manager at 15-50 person company
2. **Has confirmed the problem:** Currently does performance reviews (not "we should do them")
3. **Has budget authority:** Controls team tool budget ($500-2,000/year range)
4. **Shows urgency:** Next review cycle is <90 days away OR expressed pain in discovery call
5. **Wants to talk further:** Agreed to demo call or asked for pricing/availability

**Not qualified if:**
- Individual contributor (no direct reports)
- At enterprise company >200 people (different buying process)
- Says "interesting but not a priority" (no urgency)
- Has to "check with my boss" for $150/month decision (no budget authority)

## Primary Metrics (Track Weekly)

### 1. Qualified Leads per Week

**Definition:** Leads meeting all 5 criteria above

**Current:** 0 (pre-launch)

**Target:**
- Week 1-2: 1-2 qualified leads
- Week 3-4: 2-3 qualified leads
- Week 5-8: 3-5 qualified leads

**Source breakdown:**
- **LinkedIn outreach:** 60-70% (2-3 leads/week)
- **Community engagement:** 20-30% (1 lead/week)
- **Inbound from content:** 10% (1 lead every 2 weeks)
- **Referrals:** 10% (1 lead every 2 weeks)

**Weekly tracking (in Notion/Airtable):**
| Week | LinkedIn Leads | Community Leads | Inbound Leads | Referrals | Total Qualified |
|------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 |
| 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 3 |
| 4 | 3 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 5 |

### 2. Cost per Qualified Lead

**Definition:** Total marketing spend / Qualified leads generated

**Current:** N/A (pre-launch)

**Target:** <$20 per qualified lead (Month 1-3)

**Calculation:**
- **Month 1 spend:** $60 (LinkedIn Premium $50 + landing page hosting $10)
- **Month 1 qualified leads:** 8-12 leads
- **Cost per lead:** $60 / 10 = $6 per lead (very efficient)

**By channel (estimate):**
- **LinkedIn:** $50/month → 6-8 leads = $6-8 per lead
- **Communities:** $0/month → 2-3 leads = $0 per lead (pure time investment)
- **Inbound content:** $10/month (hosting) → 1-2 leads = $5-10 per lead

**What good looks like:**
- Month 1-3: $5-20 per lead (bootstrap-friendly)
- Month 4-6: $10-30 per lead (as you scale)
- If cost >$50/lead: Channel isn't working, reallocate budget

---

### 3. Conversion Rate (Lead → Discovery Call)

**Definition:** % of qualified leads who book a discovery call

**Current:** N/A

**Target:** >70% (if you're qualifying properly, most should want to talk)

**Funnel:**
- 10 qualified leads identified
- 7-8 book discovery calls (70-80% conversion)
- 5-6 show up for calls (70% show rate)

**If conversion <50%:** Your qualification criteria are too loose (people aren't actually interested) OR your call booking process has friction (use Calendly to reduce friction)

---

### 4. Message-to-Reply Rate (Outbound LinkedIn)

**Definition:** % of LinkedIn follow-up messages that get a reply

**Current:** N/A

**Target:** >20% (high-quality personalization should yield 1 in 5 replies)

**Funnel:**
- 50 connection requests sent
- 15-20 accepted (30-40% accept rate)
- 20 follow-up messages sent (Message 1: Value-first)
- 4-6 replies (20-30% reply rate)

**Tracking by message variation:**
| Message Type | Sent | Replies | Reply Rate |
|--------------|------|---------|------------|
| Value-share (Variation A) | 10 | 3 | 30% |
| Curiosity question (Variation B) | 10 | 2 | 20% |
| Direct offer (Variation C) | 10 | 1 | 10% |

**What good looks like:**
- >25%: Excellent (message + ICP targeting is nailed)
- 15-25%: Good (iterate on messaging)
- <15%: Poor (wrong ICP or generic messaging)

---

## Leading Indicators (Monitor, Don't Obsess)

These predict future qualified leads but aren't goals themselves:

**Website visitors (landing page):**
- Week 1-4: 50-100 visitors
- Week 5-8: 100-200 visitors
- Source: LinkedIn profile clicks, outreach messages with link, community shares

**LinkedIn connection accept rate:**
- Target: >30% (if <30%, your profile or request message needs work)

**Discovery call show rate:**
- Target: >70% (if <50%, leads aren't qualified or you're not confirming calls)

**Email open rate (if you have a waitlist newsletter):**
- Target: >40% (engaged audience)
- If <30%: Content isn't relevant or list is too cold

**Content engagement (LinkedIn posts):**
- Target: 50-100 impressions, 5-10 reactions, 2-3 comments per post
- Not a goal, but if posts get 0 engagement, your network isn't your ICP

---

## DO NOT TRACK (Vanity Metrics)

These metrics feel good but don't predict revenue:

- **Total LinkedIn followers** (unless you're building an audience business—you're not)
- **Post impressions** (reach without action = meaningless)
- **Likes without engagement** (a like is not buying intent)
- **Traffic without conversion** (1,000 visitors with 0 calls booked < 50 visitors with 5 calls)
- **Newsletter subscriber count** (if subscribers don't become qualified leads)
- **Time on site** (unless it correlates with demo bookings)

**Why vanity metrics are dangerous:**
They make you feel productive ("I got 500 impressions!") without moving the needle (0 qualified leads).

## Weekly Review Template

*Answer these every Friday—takes 15 minutes*

### 1. What drove the most qualified leads this week?
- **Example answer:** "LinkedIn outreach to engineering managers at 20-40 person startups. Sent 30 messages, got 8 replies (27% rate), booked 3 calls, 2 were qualified."
- **Why it worked:** Personalized messages referencing their recent posts about 1:1s; ICP was tightly targeted (tech startups, not agencies)

### 2. What had zero impact?
- **Example answer:** "LinkedIn posts about 'leadership tips'—got 20 likes but 0 DMs or profile visits from ICP."
- **Why:** Content was too generic, not specific to performance reviews
- **Action:** Stop posting generic leadership content; focus on review-specific pain points

### 3. What to double down on next week?
- **Example answer:** "Engineering manager outreach via LinkedIn. Goal: 50 connection requests (vs 30 this week), target 10 replies, book 5 calls, convert 3 to qualified."

### 4. What to stop doing?
- **Example answer:** "Posting in Reddit /r/managers—community is skeptical of tools, mods removed my comment. 5 hours invested, 0 leads."
- **Reason:** Wrong audience (they want free advice, not paid tools)
- **Action:** Exit that channel, reallocate 5 hours to LinkedIn outreach

### 5. Biggest learning?
- **Example answer:** "Managers with review cycles in next 30-60 days are 3x more likely to book a call. Need to ask 'When's your next review cycle?' in first message to prioritize high-urgency leads."

## Monthly Health Check

*Answer these at the end of each month:*

- [ ] **Are we hitting qualified lead targets?** (Target: 8-12 qualified leads in Month 1)
  - **If YES:** Scale winning channel (double LinkedIn outreach or test new communities)
  - **If NO:** Diagnose bottleneck (low reply rate? wrong ICP? weak messaging?)

- [ ] **Is cost per lead sustainable?** (Target: <$20/lead)
  - **If YES:** Continue current budget allocation
  - **If NO (>$30/lead):** Cut losing channels, focus on $0 channels (communities, referrals)

- [ ] **Are leads converting to calls?** (Target: >70% of qualified leads book calls)
  - **If YES:** Discovery call process is working
  - **If NO:** Fix qualification (are they really interested?) or reduce booking friction (use Calendly)

- [ ] **Is messaging resonating?** (Target: >20% reply rate)
  - **If YES:** You've found message-market fit, scale it
  - **If NO:** Test new message variations (problem-focused vs outcome-focused vs price-focused)

- [ ] **Do we need to pivot channels?** (If primary channel isn't working by Week 8)
  - **If LinkedIn reply rate <15% after 100+ messages:** Wrong ICP or messaging, try communities or cold email
  - **If community engagement gets no traction:** Focus 100% on LinkedIn, cut community time

- 15-20 discovery calls held
- 5-10 waitlist signups or beta commitments
- <$15 cost per lead
- 30%+ LinkedIn reply rate

---

## Red Flags (When to Pivot Marketing Strategy)

- [ ] **Week 4: <5 qualified leads total** → ICP is wrong or problem isn't painful
- [ ] **Week 4: <15% LinkedIn reply rate** → Messaging is off or targeting is too broad
- [ ] **Week 6: <10 discovery calls held** → Leads aren't actually interested (qualification issue)
- [ ] **Week 8: 0 waitlist signups or beta commitments** → No buying intent, category doesn't exist
- [ ] **Cost per lead >$50** → Channel is inefficient, cut it and focus on $0 channels

**If 2+ red flags by Week 8:** Pause outreach, run 10 more deep discovery calls to re-validate ICP and messaging before continuing.
