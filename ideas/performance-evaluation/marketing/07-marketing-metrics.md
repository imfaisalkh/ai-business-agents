## Leading Indicators (Monitor, Don't Obsess)

| Metric | Current | Benchmark | Notes |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Website visitors/week | | 100+ | Measure after landing page launch |
| LinkedIn connection accept rate | | 30%+ | Quality of targeting |
| LinkedIn message reply rate | | 20%+ | Message-market fit |
| Landing page conversion rate | | 5%+ | Copy effectiveness |
| Email open rate | | 40%+ | Subject line quality |
| Email click rate | | 10%+ | Content relevance |
| Content engagement (likes+comments) | | 20+ per post | Audience building |

## DO NOT TRACK (Vanity Metrics)

- **Total LinkedIn followers** - Unless you're building an audience business, followers without engagement mean nothing
- **Total impressions** - Reach without action is worthless; 1M impressions with 0 conversions = 0 value
- **Likes without comments** - Likes are polite, comments show real engagement
- **Website traffic without conversions** - 10,000 visitors who bounce > 100 visitors who convert? No.
- **Email list size** - 5,000 subscribers who don't open < 500 engaged subscribers
- **"Brand awareness"** - Unmeasurable, unfalsifiable, waste of time at this stage

## CAC Calculations (For Finance)

### Current CAC Estimate

**Fully-loaded CAC formula:**
```
CAC = (Marketing spend + Time investment) / New customers
```

**Example calculation:**
- Marketing tools: $100/month
- Time: 10 hours/week x $50/hour x 4 weeks = $2,000
- Total: $2,100/month
- If 3 customers acquired: $2,100 / 3 = $700 CAC

**Target CAC:** <$200 (for 12-month payback at $150 ARPA)

### Blended vs. Channel CAC

| Channel | Spend | Time | Customers | CAC |
|---------|-------|------|-----------|-----|
| LinkedIn | $80 | $800 | | |
| Content | $0 | $200 | | |
| Referrals | $0 | $100 | | |
| **Blended** | | | | |

*Track channel CAC to know where to invest more*
