## Connection Request Templates

### Template A: Recent Post Engagement
> Loved your post on [specific topic from their recent post]. The point about [specific insight] really resonated—I've seen that play out with my team too. Would love to connect!

**When to use:** They posted about management, reviews, 1:1s, or team challenges in last 7 days

**Character count:** 280 (safe for LinkedIn limit)

### Template B: Mutual Challenge
> Hey [Name], noticed you're leading engineering at [Company]. I'm building something to help managers like us run structured performance reviews without the Lattice price tag. Would love to connect and hear how you handle reviews!

**When to use:** No recent post, but clear ICP fit (title + company size)

**Character count:** 270

### Template C: Shared Community/Interest
> Hey [Name], fellow member of [Rands Leadership Slack / LeadDev community]. Saw you're managing a team at [Company]—would love to connect and swap notes on [topic].

**When to use:** You're both in same community or attended same event

**Character count:** 250

## Follow-Up Sequence

### Message 1 (Day 1 after accept): Value-First
> Hey [Name], thanks for connecting!
>
> Noticed you're leading [team type] at [Company]. I recently wrapped Q4 reviews for my team and realized the biggest breakthrough was showing employees their self-ratings next to my ratings BEFORE the 1:1—turned reviews into coaching conversations instead of surprises.
>
> Curious how you're handling reviews for your team? Always looking to learn from other managers.

**Goal:** Start a conversation, offer insight without pitching

**No CTA yet—just human curiosity**

---

### Message 2 (Day 3 if they reply positively): Soft Discovery
> That makes sense—[acknowledge their response].
>
> Quick question: Do your team members see their own self-review ratings compared to yours? I found that gap analysis was the biggest time-saver (30 min prep → immediately know who needs coaching on confidence vs skills).
>
> We actually built a tool for this after struggling with Google Docs for too long. Happy to show you how we do it if you're curious—no pressure either way.

**Goal:** Plant the seed, gauge interest

**If they express curiosity, move to Message 3**

---

### Message 3 (Day 7 or immediately if they ask): Demo Offer
> Based on what you shared, I think there's a fit here.
>
> We built a performance review tool specifically for teams your size (15-50 people)—employee self-review, manager gap analysis, peer feedback—all for $6-8 per person/month instead of Lattice's $11-16.
>
> Would you be open to a 15-min walkthrough? I can show you exactly how the side-by-side gap analysis works and how we handle peer feedback anonymization.
>
> Here's my calendar: [Calendly link]
>
> (If timing's not right, totally cool—happy to send you some free templates instead!)

**Goal:** Get the demo call

**Provide escape hatch (free templates) to reduce pressure**

---

### Message 4 (Day 14 if no response): Breakup Email
> Hey [Name], don't want to be that person flooding your inbox!
>
> If performance reviews become a priority (especially with Q1 coming up), I'm here. In the meantime, here's a free template I use for engineering manager reviews—figure it might be useful either way.
>
> [Link to Google Doc template]
>
> Best of luck with [their project/company goal if mentioned]!

**Goal:** Leave on good terms, provide value, keep door open

**Many people reply to breakup emails ("Sorry, crazy month—let's chat")**

## Content Themes for LinkedIn Posts

*Post 3-5x per week during active outreach phase*

### Theme 1: Behind-the-Scenes (Vulnerability + Learning)
**Example post:**
> Finished our Q4 performance reviews yesterday. Took 8 hours for 6 people.
>
> Three things I'd change:
> 1. Start self-reviews 2 weeks earlier (not 3 days before)
> 2. Ask "What support do you need?" instead of "What are your goals?"
> 3. Review the self-review ratings BEFORE writing mine (avoid anchoring)
>
> What's one thing you'd change about your last review cycle?

**Why it works:** Relatable, specific, invites conversation

### Theme 2: Customer Insights (Social Proof)
**Example post:**
> Just talked to a product manager at a 20-person startup.
>
> They've been copying last quarter's Google Doc for 2 years. Each time, they promise themselves "next quarter I'll organize this."
>
> The pain isn't the reviews themselves—it's the guilt of knowing you're doing it poorly.
>
> If you're nodding, you're not alone. 🫠

**Why it works:** Mirror their pain, build empathy, subtly position product as solution

### Theme 3: Contrarian Takes (Challenge Conventional Wisdom)
**Example post:**
> Hot take: Annual performance reviews are fine.
>
> The problem isn't frequency. It's that managers:
> - Use reviews for surprises ("btw you're struggling")
> - Don't collect self-reviews first
> - Skip peer feedback because it's a pain to aggregate
>
> Fix the process, not the calendar.

**Why it works:** Provocative, drives engagement, positions you as thoughtful

### Theme 4: Data/Numbers (Credibility Builder)
**Example post:**
> Spent 30 hours in customer discovery calls this month. One pattern keeps coming up:
>
> Managers at 15-30 person companies spend $0 or $2,000+ on performance tools. Nothing in between.
>
> Either Google Docs (free but chaotic) or Lattice ($2,640/year for 20 people).
>
> The $1,000-1,500/year option doesn't exist. Yet.

**Why it works:** Numbers = credibility, identifies market gap, builds curiosity

### Theme 5: Ask Questions (Engagement Bait)
**Example post:**
> Quick poll: How do you collect peer feedback for performance reviews?
>
> A) Google Form (manual aggregation)
> B) Ask in 1:1s (no anonymity)
> C) We don't do peer feedback
> D) [Paid tool like Lattice]
>
> Curious what works for teams under 50 people.

**Why it works:** Low-friction engagement, gives you market research data, starts conversations

## Tools & Automation

### Must-Have (Free)
- **Calendly:** Easy demo scheduling, reduces back-and-forth
- **Notion/Airtable:** Track connections (Name, Company, Stage, Last Touchpoint, Next Action)
- **LinkedIn Mobile App:** Faster to send connection requests on mobile

### Nice-to-Have (Paid)
- **LinkedIn Premium ($50/month):** InMail credits, advanced search, "Who viewed your profile"
- **Sales Navigator ($80/month):** Advanced filters, lead lists, CRM integration
- **Expandi or Dripify ($30-50/month):** Automate connection requests + follow-ups (use sparingly—personalization > volume)

### DO NOT Use
- **Mass connection spamming tools:** LinkedIn will flag and restrict your account
- **Generic message templates sent to 100s:** Reply rates will tank (<5%)

---

## Red Flags (When to Pause Outreach)

- [ ] **Connection accept rate <10%:** Your targeting or message is off
- [ ] **Reply rate <5%:** Your follow-up messages are too sales-y or generic
- [ ] **LinkedIn restricts your account:** Slow down, add more personalization
- [ ] **Discovery calls have low show rate (<50%):** Wrong ICP or not qualifying properly
- [ ] **No one mentions budget/timeline after 20 calls:** Category doesn't exist, pivot needed
