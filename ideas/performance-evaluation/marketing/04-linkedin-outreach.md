## Follow-Up Sequence

### Message 1 (Day 1 after accept): Value-First
**Goal:** Establish goodwill, learn about their situation

```
Hey [First Name], thanks for connecting!

Noticed [Company] is at that interesting 15-30 person stage where processes start to matter more. Curious - how are you handling performance reviews right now?

No pitch here, genuinely curious since I'm building in this space and trying to learn from folks in the trenches.
```

**Alternative if they posted recently:**
```
Hey [First Name], thanks for connecting!

Loved your recent post about [topic]. [Specific comment showing you read it].

Quick question - how are you currently handling performance reviews at [Company]? Always curious how growing teams approach this.
```

### Message 2 (Day 3-4): Soft Value Add
**Goal:** Share something useful based on their response (or probe if no response)

**If they responded about current process:**
```
That makes sense - [acknowledge their current approach].

Since you mentioned [their pain point], thought you might find this useful: [share relevant template or tip].

[Specific insight based on what they shared].
```

**If no response:**
```
Hey [First Name] - know you're probably slammed.

Quick thought: created this [engineering review template / manager self-review guide] that similar teams have found useful. Happy to share if helpful.

Either way, hope [Company] is crushing it!
```

### Message 3 (Day 7-8): Direct Offer
**Goal:** Propose a conversation (only if engagement signals exist)

**If positive signals (replied, engaged with content):**
```
[First Name] - based on our chat, sounds like [restate their pain point].

Would you be open to a quick 15-min call to see if what I'm building could help? I can show you how [similar company type] handles [specific challenge they mentioned].

Here's my calendar if easier: [Calendly link]

If timing's bad, no worries - happy to stay in touch.
```

**If lukewarm signals:**
```
Hey [First Name] - circling back on review processes.

Curious: what would make your next review cycle less painful? Trying to figure out what matters most to teams like yours.

If you've got 15 min, I'd love to learn more about how you're thinking about this: [Calendly link]
```

### Message 4 (Day 14-15): Breakup
**Goal:** Close the loop respectfully, leave door open

```
Hey [First Name] - I'll stop filling your inbox!

If performance reviews become a priority at [Company], I'm here. In the meantime, here's a free review template that might be useful whenever you need it: [link]

Best of luck with everything - [Company] looks like it's doing great things!
```

## Handling Responses

### Positive Response: "Tell me more"
```
Great! Here's the quick version:

I'm building TeamPulse - 360-degree performance reviews (self-review, peer feedback, goal tracking) for teams of 10-50 people. Basically Lattice features at half the price, with 15-minute setup.

Would love to show you a quick demo or just chat about what you're dealing with now. Got 15 min this week?

[Calendly link]
```

### Interested but Timing: "Not now, maybe later"
```
Totally understand - no rush at all.

When's your next review cycle? Happy to check back in a few weeks before things get hectic.

In the meantime, I'll send over our review template - might be useful for planning.
```

### Objection: "We use Lattice/15Five"
```
Nice - those are solid tools for bigger teams.

Curious: do you use all the features? I hear from a lot of 15-30 person teams that they're paying for engagement surveys and OKR platforms they never touch.

If you ever want to compare, happy to chat. But if Lattice is working well, stick with it!
```

### Objection: "We just use spreadsheets"
```
Spreadsheets totally work! Especially at smaller scale.

The pain usually hits around 15+ people when tracking reviews across quarters gets messy. If you get to that point and want to upgrade, happy to show you what a lightweight alternative looks like.

For now, here's a review template that might make your spreadsheet life easier: [link]
```

### Objection: "Not my decision"
```
Got it - who handles review process decisions at [Company]? Happy to connect with them directly if you think it'd be relevant.

Or feel free to forward this along: [one-liner about TeamPulse]
```

### No Response After Sequence
Add to "future follow-up" list. Re-engage in 2-3 months with:
- New content share
- Product update
- Before their review cycle (Q4/Q1)

## Pro Tips

1. **Personalize the first line:** Always reference something specific about them (post, company, role change). Generic requests get ignored.

2. **Send requests Tuesday-Thursday:** Highest acceptance rates mid-week, 9am-11am and 2pm-4pm.

3. **Don't pitch in connection requests:** The 300-character limit isn't for your sales pitch. Build the relationship first.

4. **Follow before connecting:** Following first shows genuine interest and can increase accept rates.

5. **Engage with their content first:** Like/comment on their posts before connecting. Warm leads convert better.

6. **Match their energy:** If they're casual, be casual. If they're formal, be professional. Mirror their communication style.

7. **Track everything:** What messages get responses? What doesn't? Iterate weekly based on data.
