## Follow-Up Message Sequences

### Sequence A: Standard Follow-Up (Post-Connection)

**Message 1** (Day 0 - After Accept)
> Thanks for connecting, [First Name]!

> Quick question - how does [Company] handle performance reviews currently? Curious if you've run into the spreadsheet chaos most small teams deal with.

**Message 2** (Day 3 - If No Reply)
> No worries if reviews aren't top of mind right now.

> I put together a free engineering performance review template that a lot of managers have found useful. Want me to send it over?

**Message 3** (Day 7 - If No Reply)
> Last ping - I help small teams run structured reviews without the Lattice price tag ($11/employee).

> If you ever want to chat about what you're doing for reviews, happy to share some ideas. Either way, good luck with everything at [Company]!

### Sequence B: High-Intent Follow-Up (Engaged Prospect)

**Message 1** (Day 0 - After Positive Reply)
> Great to hear! Most managers I talk to are either stuck with spreadsheets or sticker-shocked by Lattice.

> What's your biggest pain point with your current process? I'd love to share how we approach [specific pain] if it'd be helpful.

**Message 2** (Day 1 - If Continues Engaging)
> Makes total sense. Would you be open to a quick 15-min call to show you what we're building?

> I can also share some templates regardless of whether the tool is a fit.

> [Calendly link]

**Message 3** (Day 3 - If Books Call)
> Looking forward to chatting on [date/time]!

> To make our time valuable, I'll plan to show you:
> 1. How self-reviews + gap analysis works
> 2. How peer feedback gets aggregated
> 3. Templates we built for [their role/industry]

> Anything specific you want to cover?

### Sequence C: Nurture Sequence (Not Ready Now)

**Message 1** (Day 0 - After "Not Now" Reply)
> Totally understand - timing is everything.

> Mind if I check back in when you're closer to your next review cycle? When does that usually happen?

**Message 2** (30 Days Later)
> Hey [First Name], hope things are going well at [Company]!

> Circling back - is performance review season coming up? Happy to share some resources or hop on a quick call if it'd be helpful.

**Message 3** (60 Days Later - If No Reply)
> Hey! Just published a guide on running 360 reviews for small teams. Thought of you - here's the link if you're interested: [link]

> No pressure, just wanted to share something useful.

## Response Handling

### Positive Responses

**"Yes, tell me more"**
> Awesome! Quick overview: we help small teams run proper 360 reviews (self-review, peer feedback, manager evaluation) without the enterprise price tag.

> Most managers save ~30 min per review compared to spreadsheets, and your employees actually get to see their own feedback.

> Would a quick 15-min call make sense? I can show you the tool and share some templates either way.
> [Calendly link]

**"What does it cost?"**
> Great question! We're at $6-8 per employee/month - about 50% less than Lattice.

> For a 25-person team, that's ~$150-200/month vs $275-400 for enterprise tools.

> The big difference is we focus on what small teams actually need: self-reviews, peer feedback, and goal tracking. No bloated features you won't use.

> Want me to show you how it works? [Calendly link]

**"We use Lattice/15Five"**
> Nice - both solid tools! How's it working for you?

> Most teams I talk to who use Lattice either love it or feel like they're paying for features they don't need.

> If it's working well, I'd actually love to hear what you like about it - always learning. And if there's ever anything frustrating, happy to chat about alternatives.

### Neutral Responses

**"Maybe later"**
> Totally get it. When's your next review cycle? I can ping you a month before to see if timing is better.

> In the meantime, happy to send over some free templates if you want.

**"Send more info"**
> Sure! Here's the quick version:

> **What it does:** 360-degree reviews with self-review, peer feedback, and gap analysis
> **Why it's different:** Enterprise features at $6-8/employee (vs $11+ for Lattice)
> **Best for:** Teams of 15-50 who've outgrown spreadsheets

> Here's our site: [link]

> Worth a 15-min call to show you how it works? [Calendly link]

### Negative Responses

**"Not interested"**
> No problem - appreciate you letting me know. Good luck with everything at [Company]!

**"We don't do formal reviews"**
> Totally fair! Out of curiosity, how do you handle feedback and growth conversations?

> Some teams skip formal reviews and do more frequent check-ins instead. Others just haven't formalized yet.

> Either way, no pitch - just curious how different teams approach it.

**"Too expensive" / "No budget"**
> Understand. At $6/employee, we're actually the most affordable option with self-reviews and peer feedback included.

> For context, that's $90/month for a 15-person team - probably less than one team lunch.

> But if budget is tight, happy to share some free templates that might help in the meantime.

## Content to Support Outreach

### LinkedIn Post Templates

**Post 1: Pain Point**
> "Spreadsheets for performance reviews" is the startup equivalent of using Post-it notes for project management.

> It works until it doesn't.

> Then you're searching for last quarter's feedback across 4 different folders, chasing people for peer reviews, and hoping you remember what you said 6 months ago.

> At some point, every growing team needs to level up. The question is: when?

**Post 2: Hot Take**
> Hot take: Most performance review software is built for HR, not managers.

> That's why it costs $11/employee, takes 6 weeks to implement, and requires "training."

> What if reviews were built for the people actually doing them?

**Post 3: Value Share**
> Free template: Engineering Performance Review (Junior/Mid/Senior)

> Includes:
> - Technical competencies by level
> - Self-review questions
> - Manager evaluation criteria
> - Gap analysis framework

> Drop a comment and I'll DM you the link.

### Resource to Share

- Free Engineering Performance Review Template (Google Doc)
