### Problem Section

**Header:** "Sound familiar?"

**Pain points:**

1. **"Review season means 2 weeks of chaos"**
   Copy-pasting from last quarter's Google Doc. Hunting for the feedback you swore you wrote down. Employees asking "where's my review?" and you're not sure.

2. **"Enterprise tools want $15K/year for features you'll never use"**
   Lattice, 15Five, Culture Amp - built for companies with HR teams and budget. You have 20 people and a Notion workspace.

3. **"Your team never sees the feedback you write"**
   They get a summary meeting. Maybe. You have detailed ratings sitting in a folder no one can access. Employees feel in the dark about their growth.

---

### Solution Section

**Header:** "There's a better way"

**Key benefits:**

1. **See the gap between self-review and manager review**
   Employees rate themselves. You rate them. TeamPulse shows you the difference - so your 1:1 becomes a coaching conversation, not a monologue.

2. **Peer feedback that's actually useful**
   Anonymous, aggregated insights from teammates. No more "everyone says you're great" - real feedback that helps people grow.

3. **Goal tracking that connects to reviews**
   Set quarterly goals. Track progress. Reference them in reviews. No more "what did you even work on last quarter?"

---

### How It Works (3 steps)

**Header:** "From zero to first review in 15 minutes"

1. **Add your team**
   Import from CSV or add manually. Assign managers, set up peer relationships. Takes 5 minutes.

2. **Pick a template**
   Choose from pre-built templates (Engineering, Sales, Manager) or customize your own. Skip the 2-week setup.

3. **Launch your cycle**
   Employees get self-review requests. Peers get feedback requests. You get a dashboard tracking completion. Done.

### FAQ (Top 5 questions)

**1. "How long does setup take?"**
Most teams are running their first review cycle within 15-30 minutes. Import your team, pick a template, launch. No implementation consultants required.

**2. "Can employees see their reviews?"**
Yes - and that's the point. Employees complete self-reviews, see their manager's feedback, and compare ratings. Transparency drives better conversations.

**3. "How does peer feedback work?"**
You define peer relationships (or let employees nominate). Feedback is collected anonymously and aggregated. Employees see themes, not who said what.

**4. "What if we grow past 50 employees?"**
TeamPulse scales with you. Same pricing, same features. When you need enterprise features (SSO, API, advanced analytics), we have Enterprise plans.

**5. "Can we import from Lattice/15Five?"**
Yes - we can help migrate your historical review data. Contact us and we'll walk you through it.

**6. "Is our data secure?"**
SOC 2 Type II certification in progress. GDPR compliant. Data encrypted at rest and in transit. Hosted on AWS with regular backups.
