# Landing Page Strategy

## Page Structure

### Above the Fold

**Headline:**
"Run 360-Degree Performance Reviews Without the $2K/Month Enterprise Price Tag"

**Subheadline:**
"Give your 15-50 person team structured self-review, peer feedback, and goal tracking for $6-8 per employee/month—50% cheaper than Lattice, zero setup time."

**Primary CTA:**
"Book a 15-Minute Demo" (Calendly link)

**Secondary CTA:**
"Join the Waitlist" (Email capture form)

**Social proof element:**
- **Option A (Early stage):** "Built by engineering managers who were tired of copying last quarter's Google Docs"
- **Option B (With traction):** Logo bar of 5-10 beta customers (if allowed) OR "Trusted by 15+ teams at startups and agencies"
- **Option C (With testimonials):** One-line quote: "Saved us 8 hours and $1,800/year vs Lattice" - Engineering Manager, 25-person startup

### Problem Section

**Header:** "Sound familiar?"

**Pain points (3):**

1. **"Copy-pasting last quarter's Google Doc… again."**
   You know you should have templates and structure, but every review cycle you're scrambling. Your team deserves better, and so do you.

2. **"Peer feedback is a manual nightmare."**
   You send a Google Form, then spend 2 hours anonymizing responses and aggregating feedback. By the time you're done, reviews feel like data entry.

3. **"You're paying $11-16 per employee for features you don't use."**
   Lattice and 15Five have engagement surveys, OKRs, and integrations you'll never touch. You just want clean performance reviews without the enterprise bloat.

---

### Solution Section

**Header:** "There's a better way"

**Key benefits (3):**

1. **See the gap between self-ratings and your ratings—before the 1:1**
   Side-by-side comparison shows where employees under- or over-rate themselves. Turn reviews into coaching conversations, not surprises. (This is what managers tell us saves them 30 min per review.)

2. **Peer feedback that doesn't require a spreadsheet PhD**
   Your team gives peer feedback in 5 minutes. We anonymize, aggregate, and surface themes automatically. You focus on the conversation, not the data wrangling.

3. **Pre-built templates for Engineers, Managers, and Sales Reps**
   Pick "Mid-Level Software Engineer" or "Senior Product Manager," customize if needed, and launch reviews in 15 minutes. No training, no onboarding calls, no 2-week setup.

---

### How It Works (3 steps)

1. **Import your team (15 min)**
   Connect Slack or upload a CSV. Pick role-based templates (Junior Engineer, Senior Manager, etc.). Customize questions if you want (or use ours as-is).

2. **Launch self-review + peer feedback (5 min)**
   Employees rate themselves on 5-8 competencies and request peer feedback from 2-3 teammates. Peers respond in 5-10 minutes with anonymized, structured feedback.

3. **Review the gap analysis + have better 1:1s**
   Open the side-by-side view: employee's self-ratings vs your ratings vs aggregated peer feedback. Walk into the 1:1 with clarity on what to coach, not just what to say.

### Social Proof

**Testimonial focus:** Highlight time saved, clarity gained, and cost savings

**Format:** 2-3 testimonial cards

#### Testimonial 1: Time Savings
> "The gap analysis changed my 1:1s completely. I used to spend 2 hours prepping for reviews; now I spend 30 minutes and walk in way more prepared. Seeing my engineer rated themselves 2/5 on Impact (I had them at 5/5) opened up a 30-minute conversation about imposter syndrome. Without the side-by-side view, I wouldn't have known."
>
> **— Alex Chen, Engineering Manager, 30-person SaaS startup**

#### Testimonial 2: Cost Savings
> "We almost signed up for Lattice ($2,640/year for our 20-person team). Found this instead, saved $1,200/year and got the same features we actually need. Setup took 20 minutes."
>
> **— Priya Sharma, Head of People, digital agency**

#### Testimonial 3: Peer Feedback
> "Collecting peer feedback used to take me 3 hours per review cycle (Google Forms + manual aggregation). Now it's automatic. Employees give feedback in 5 minutes, and I get clean, anonymized summaries. Game changer."
>
> **— Jordan Lee, Product Manager, 25-person fintech startup**

**Numbers to highlight (if available):**
- "Saves managers 30+ minutes per review"
- "50% cheaper than Lattice ($6-8 PEPM vs $11-16)"
- "80%+ employee self-review completion rate"
- "15 minutes to launch your first review cycle"

### FAQ (Top 5 questions)

1. **"How is this different from Lattice or 15Five?"**
   We focus exclusively on performance reviews (self-review, peer feedback, goal tracking) without the enterprise bloat (engagement surveys, OKRs, pulse surveys). You get the same core features at $6-8 PEPM instead of $11-16. Built for teams of 15-50, not enterprise HR departments.

2. **"What if my team is smaller than 15 people?"**
   We support teams as small as 5 people. Pricing starts at ~$50/month minimum. If you're doing performance reviews for 5+ people, you'll still save time vs Google Docs and money vs enterprise tools.

3. **"How long does setup take?"**
   15 minutes. Import your team from Slack or CSV, pick role-based templates (or create custom), and send the first self-review. No training calls, no onboarding sessions. If you can use Notion, you can use this.

4. **"Can employees see each other's reviews?"**
   No. Reviews are private between the employee and their manager. Peer feedback is anonymized and aggregated (individual peer responses are never shown). You control visibility.

5. **"Do you integrate with our HR system (BambooHR, Rippling, etc.)?"**
   Not yet—this is on our roadmap. For now, you can import team data via CSV or Slack. Takes 5 minutes. We'll sync updates manually with you each quarter if needed.

## Copy Guidelines

- **Reading level:** 8th grade (use Hemingway Editor to check)
- **Tone:** Helpful manager-to-manager (not salesy, not corporate HR speak)
- **Word count target:** 800-1,000 words total (scannability > length)
- **Scannability:**
  - Short paragraphs (2-3 lines max)
  - Bullet points and numbered lists
  - Bold key phrases (e.g., "side-by-side comparison," "30 min per review")
  - Use "you" and "your" (make it personal)

**Words to use:**
- Side-by-side, gap analysis, anonymized, structured, clarity, coaching conversations, time-saving

**Words to avoid:**
- Synergy, leverage, optimize, facilitate, best-in-class, revolutionary (sounds like corporate BS)

## A/B Test Ideas

*Once you have traffic (100+ visitors), test these variations:*

- [ ] **Headline:** Problem-focused ("Stop copying last quarter's Google Doc") vs Outcome-focused ("Run 360-degree reviews in 15 minutes") vs Price-focused ("Enterprise reviews for $6-8 PEPM")

- [ ] **CTA:** "Book Demo" vs "See a Demo" vs "Get Started Free" vs "Start Free Trial"

- [ ] **Social proof:** Customer logos vs Testimonial quotes vs Stats ("50+ teams, 80%+ completion rate")

- [ ] **Pricing visibility:** Pricing table on landing page vs "See Pricing" button vs No pricing (force demo)

- [ ] **Feature emphasis:** Lead with "Gap Analysis" (differentiator) vs "Peer Feedback" (common need) vs "Time Savings" (ROI)

---

## Mobile Optimization

*30-40% of traffic will be mobile—test these:*

- [ ] Headline fits on one line (mobile viewport)
- [ ] CTA button is thumb-friendly (48x48px minimum)
- [ ] Form fields are minimal (Name + Email only for waitlist)
- [ ] Page loads in <3 seconds on 4G
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling on 375px width (iPhone SE)

## Analytics Setup

**Track these events (use product/02-prd.md MVP Funnel events):**

- `landing_page_view` - Total visitors
- `cta_clicked` (with property: `button_type: "demo" or "waitlist"`)
- `demo_booked` - Calendly confirmation
- `waitlist_joined` - Email submitted
- `scroll_depth` (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) - Engagement depth

**Success metrics:**
- **Demo booking rate:** >5% of visitors (100 visitors → 5 demo bookings)
- **Waitlist conversion:** >10% of visitors (100 visitors → 10 emails)
- **Bounce rate:** <60% (if >70%, headline or messaging is off)
