# Lead Validation Tactics

*Generated for: Performance Evaluation Tool*

---

## Validation Framework

### The Goal

Before writing code, validate:
1. **Problem exists** - People actually struggle with performance reviews
2. **Problem is painful enough** - They'll pay to solve it
3. **Our solution resonates** - Self-review + peer feedback + affordable pricing hits

### Validation Stages

```
Stage 1: Problem Validation (Week 1-2)
    └─> 10 discovery calls
    └─> Goal: Confirm pain points, learn current solutions

Stage 2: Solution Validation (Week 3-4)
    └─> 10 solution interviews
    └─> Goal: Test feature set, pricing reaction

Stage 3: Commitment Validation (Week 5-6)
    └─> 5 beta customers
    └─> Goal: Get usage, not just words

Stage 4: Revenue Validation (Week 7-8)
    └─> 5 paying customers
    └─> Goal: People pay real money
```

## Stage 1: Problem Validation

### Discovery Call Goals

- Confirm ICP characteristics
- Understand current process deeply
- Identify pain points and workarounds
- Learn what they've tried before

### Questions to Ask

**Current State:**
1. "Walk me through how you do performance reviews today."
2. "What tools do you use? (Spreadsheets, existing software, nothing?)"
3. "How often do you do reviews? Quarterly? Annually?"
4. "How many people do you review directly?"

**Pain Points:**
5. "What's the most frustrating part of your current process?"
6. "How much time do you spend on reviews per cycle?"
7. "What happens when you need to reference a review from 6 months ago?"
8. "Do your employees get to see their reviews? Self-review?"

**Stakes:**
9. "What happens if reviews don't get done or are inconsistent?"
10. "Have you ever had issues with undocumented performance problems?"
11. "What's this costing you in terms of time or team issues?"

**Solutions Tried:**
12. "Have you looked at any tools for this? What did you think?"
13. "What would the ideal solution look like?"
14. "What's your budget for something like this?"

### Validation Signals

| Signal | Strength | What It Means |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| "Yes, this is painful" | Weak | Everyone says reviews are painful |
| "I've looked at tools" | Medium | Actively shopping |
| "I tried X but it didn't work" | Strong | Motivated buyer |
| "I'd pay $X for this" | Strong | Price validated |
| "Can I be a beta tester?" | Very Strong | Ready to commit |
| "I'll pay now" | Strongest | Do not pass go, take their money |

### Disqualification Signals

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| "We don't really do formal reviews" | Thank them, move on |
| "Our team is 5 people" | Too small, revisit later |
| "We use Lattice and love it" | Not a buyer |
| "I'm not the decision maker" | Find the real buyer |
| "We have no budget" | Nurture list |

## Stage 2: Solution Validation

### Solution Interview Goals

- Test specific feature resonance
- Validate pricing
- Identify must-haves vs nice-to-haves
- Get feedback on positioning

### What to Show

**Option A: Figma Prototype**
- 5-10 screens showing core flows
- Self-review submission
- Manager review with gap analysis
- Peer feedback aggregation

**Option B: Competitor Screenshots + Differentiation**
- "This is what Lattice looks like at $11/employee"
- "Here's what we're building at $7/employee"
- "What features would you need?"

**Option C: Loom Walkthrough**
- 3-5 minute video of MVP concept
- Narrated screens explaining each feature
- Pause for reaction and questions

### Questions to Ask

**Feature Validation:**
1. "If you could only have 3 features, which would they be?"
   - Self-review
   - Peer feedback
   - Goal tracking
   - Templates
   - Analytics
   - Reminders

2. "Is self-review with gap analysis valuable? Why/why not?"
3. "How important is peer feedback anonymization?"
4. "Would you use pre-built templates or build your own?"

**Pricing Validation:**
5. "What are you paying now (time or money)?"
6. "Would you pay $7/employee/month for this?"
7. "At what price would you say no?"
8. "Would you pay annually upfront for a discount?"

**Commitment Test:**
9. "If we built this in 4 weeks, would you be a beta user?"
10. "Would you pay $50/month for early access?"
11. "Can I follow up when we launch?"

### Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity

Ask these 4 questions to nail pricing:

1. "At what price would this be so cheap you'd question quality?" → Floor
2. "At what price is this a great deal?" → Low end
3. "At what price does it start to feel expensive?" → High end
4. "At what price is it too expensive to consider?" → Ceiling

**Expected Answers:**
- Floor: $3-4 PEPM
- Low end: $5-6 PEPM
- High end: $8-10 PEPM
- Ceiling: $12-15 PEPM

**Conclusion:** $6-8 PEPM is the sweet spot

### Beta Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Beta signups | 5+ | Enough to learn patterns |
| Completed review cycles | 3+ | Actual usage, not just signup |
| Weekly feedback calls completed | 80%+ | Engaged beta users |
| NPS after beta | 8+ | Would recommend |
| Convert to paid | 60%+ | Validated value |

---

## Stage 4: Revenue Validation

### Pre-Launch Pricing Test

**Option A: Founding Member Pricing**
- $5/employee/month (locked forever)
- Limited to first 10 customers
- Creates urgency and validates willingness to pay

**Option B: Annual Prepay Discount**
- Pay $50/employee/year (vs $84/year at $7/month)
- 40% discount for annual commitment
- Validates strong intent

**Option C: Pilot Program**
- $99/month flat for 3 months (any team size under 30)
- Low-risk entry point
- Converts to standard pricing after pilot

### Revenue Validation Signals

| Signal | Strength |
|--------|----------|
| Credit card on file | Strong |
| Paid first month | Very Strong |
| Paid annual upfront | Strongest |
| Used for actual reviews | Ultimate validation |

### Kill Criteria

**Kill the idea if:**
- <5% reply rate on 200+ LinkedIn outreach attempts
- <20% of discovery calls express buying intent
- <10% of solution interviews willing to pay
- 0 beta customers willing to use for real reviews
- 0 paying customers after 6 weeks of sales

**Pivot if:**
- Pain exists but pricing is wrong → Test lower price
- Wrong ICP → Test different segment
- Feature set wrong → Add/remove features
- Messaging wrong → Test different positioning
