# Go-to-Market Strategy

> **Purpose:** The action plan for getting TeamPulse in front of customers. Focuses on 2 channels max.
>
> **Fits in:** Executes on ICP (01) and Positioning (02). Drives LinkedIn Outreach (04) and content calendar.

## GTM Phase: Discovery/Validation

*Months 1-3: Validate ICP, messaging, and willingness to pay before scaling*

## Channel Strategy (Pick 2 Max)

### Primary Channel: LinkedIn Outbound

**Why this channel:**
- ICP (engineering managers, HR leaders) is highly active on LinkedIn
- Can reach decision-makers directly (no gatekeepers)
- Low cost ($50/month for Premium/Sales Nav)
- Fast feedback loop - know within 1 week if messaging resonates
- Warm outreach (connection + value) outperforms cold email for B2B SaaS

**Weekly time investment:** 5-6 hours/week
- 1 hour: Finding and qualifying prospects (Monday)
- 2 hours: Sending personalized connection requests (Tuesday/Wednesday)
- 1 hour: Following up with new connections (Thursday)
- 1 hour: Engaging with ICP content (daily, 15 min)
- 1 hour: Creating/posting content (Friday)

**Key tactics:**
1. **Targeted connection requests:** 25-50/week to engineering managers and HR leads at 10-50 person companies, personalized with company/role context
2. **Value-first follow-ups:** Share useful content (review templates, manager guides) before any pitch
3. **Content posting:** 3x/week posts about performance review tips, first-time manager challenges, template giveaways
4. **Comment engagement:** 10-20 comments/week on ICP posts and influencer content (Lara Hogan, Julie Zhuo, etc.)

**Success metric:**
- Week 1-2: 30%+ connection accept rate
- Week 3-4: 15%+ reply rate on follow-up messages
- Month 1: 5+ discovery calls booked
- Month 2: 2+ trial signups from LinkedIn
- Month 3: 1+ paying customer from LinkedIn

**When to scale:** Double investment when hitting 20%+ reply rate and 10+ calls/month
**When to abandon:** <10% accept rate after 100 requests, <5% reply rate after 50 conversations

### Secondary Channel: Content/SEO (Long-term)

**Why this channel:**
- "Performance review template" = 8,000+ monthly searches
- ICPs actively searching for review help during Q1/Q4 cycles
- Compounds over time - content from Month 1 drives leads in Month 6
- Establishes authority and trust before sales conversations

**Weekly time investment:** 2-3 hours/week
- 1 hour: Writing one blog post or template
- 1 hour: Optimizing/updating existing content
- 30 min: Sharing content across channels

**Key tactics:**
1. **Template library:** Create 5-10 free review templates (Engineering, Sales, Manager levels) as lead magnets
2. **Blog content:** Weekly posts targeting "performance review" + modifier keywords
3. **Comparison pages:** "TeamPulse vs Lattice" and "TeamPulse vs Small Improvements" pages
4. **Landing page SEO:** Optimize for "performance review software small business"

**Target keywords (by intent):**
| Keyword | Monthly Volume | Intent | Priority |
|---------|----------------|--------|----------|
| performance review template | 8,100 | Informational | High |
| employee self evaluation | 4,400 | Informational | High |
| 360 feedback template | 2,900 | Informational | Medium |
| lattice alternative | 720 | Commercial | High |
| performance review software small business | 320 | Commercial | High |
| how to give performance review | 2,400 | Informational | Medium |

**Success metric:**
- Month 1: 5 template downloads from organic
- Month 3: 500 monthly organic visitors
- Month 6: 50 monthly organic visitors to commercial pages
- Month 6: 2+ trial signups from organic/month

**When to scale:** Hire writer when organic drives 10+ qualified leads/month
**When to abandon:** Zero traction after 6 months of consistent publishing

- Test when LinkedIn playbook is proven

- Target: Manager Tools, Supermanagers, Engineering Leadership podcasts
- Good for authority building, long-term brand
- Lower ROI than direct outreach initially

### Community Participation (Ongoing)
