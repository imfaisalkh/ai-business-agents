# Go-to-Market Strategy

## GTM Phase: Discovery/Validation

## Channel Strategy (Pick 2 Max)

### Primary Channel: LinkedIn Outreach (Founder-Led)
- **Why this channel:** Engineering/Product managers are highly active on LinkedIn, often posting about management challenges. Easy to identify ICP via job title + company size filters. High-intent conversations (vs broadcast content).

- **Weekly time investment:** 5-7 hours per week
  - 2 hours: Identify 50 new ICP profiles (LinkedIn search/Sales Nav)
  - 2 hours: Send 25-30 personalized connection requests + follow-ups
  - 1 hour: Engage with ICP posts (thoughtful comments)
  - 2 hours: Discovery calls with warm connections

- **Key tactics:**
  1. **Search query:** `"Engineering Manager" OR "Product Manager" OR "Operations Manager" + company size:11-50 employees + location:United States` (refine for tech/agency sectors)
  2. **Connection request strategy:** Reference their recent post/activity + offer value (not pitch)
  3. **3-message follow-up sequence:** Day 1 (value share) → Day 3 (curiosity question) → Day 7 (demo offer) → Day 14 (breakup)
  4. **Profile optimization:** Update headline to "Helping managers run better performance reviews" + featured section with customer testimonials

- **Success metric:**
  - Week 1-4: 15% connection accept rate, 5 discovery calls booked
  - Week 5-8: 20% accept rate, 10 calls/week, 2-3 qualified leads (confirmed budget + timeline)

- **When to scale/abandon:**
  - **Scale:** If >20% reply rate with positive sentiment + 2+ qualified leads/week by Week 8
  - **Abandon:** If <10% accept rate or <1 qualified lead after 100+ connections (signal: wrong ICP or messaging)

### Secondary Channel: Community Engagement (Rands Leadership Slack, Manager's Club)
- **Why this channel:** High-trust environments where managers ask candid questions about reviews. Can offer help before pitching. Moderators often become advocates if you add value.

- **Weekly time investment:** 2-3 hours per week
  - 1 hour: Answer questions in #performance-reviews, #1-on-1s channels
  - 1 hour: DM 3-5 people who asked review-related questions (offer templates/advice)
  - 30 min: Post weekly tip (e.g., "Gap analysis framework for review conversations")

- **Key tactics:**
  1. **Lead with value:** Share templates, frameworks, or insights before mentioning product
  2. **DM strategy:** "Saw your question about peer feedback—here's how we handle it [insight]. Happy to share our template if useful."
  3. **Moderate self-promotion:** 80% help, 20% mention product in context ("We built X to solve this—DM if you want to see it")
  4. **Build relationships:** Focus on 10-15 active members, help them consistently

- **Success metric:**
  - Week 1-4: Helpful contributor reputation (upvotes, DM requests)
  - Week 5-8: 2-3 DM conversations per week → 1 demo call

- **When to scale/abandon:**
  - **Scale:** If community members start referring others to you ("Ask [your name], they know reviews")
  - **Abandon:** If <1 meaningful conversation after 50+ messages or mods warn about self-promotion

## 30-Day Launch Plan

### Week 1: Foundation
- [x] **Optimize LinkedIn profile:** Update headline ("Helping engineering managers run structured performance reviews"), add featured section for early content, update summary with founder story
- [x] **Identify 50 ICP targets:** Use LinkedIn search (`"Engineering Manager" + 11-50 employees + tech/agency`) and export to spreadsheet
- [x] **Draft messaging variations:** Write 3 connection request templates (mutual interest, value share, direct question) and 3-message follow-up sequence
- [x] **Create simple landing page:** One-pager with headline ("360-degree reviews for $6-8 PEPM"), problem/solution, feature list, CTA (book demo or join waitlist)
- [x] **Join 2-3 communities:** Request access to Rands Leadership Slack, Manager's Club; lurk to understand norms

### Week 2: Outreach Begins
- [ ] **Send 20 personalized connection requests:** Focus on managers who recently posted about reviews, 1:1s, or team challenges
- [ ] **Post 3x on LinkedIn:**
  - Post 1: "Why I'm building this" (founder story + problem)
  - Post 2: "The gap analysis framework" (free value, no pitch)
  - Post 3: "What managers get wrong about peer feedback" (insight from customer calls)
- [ ] **Have 5 customer discovery calls:** DM warm connections or existing network; use `product/05-interview-template.md` questions
- [ ] **Refine messaging based on feedback:** Note which phrases resonate, which objections come up repeatedly
- [ ] **Engage in communities:** Answer 5-10 questions in Slack channels, add value without pitching

### Week 3: Iterate
- [ ] **Send 30 connection requests:** Expand to adjacent roles (VP Eng, Heads of People at small companies)
- [ ] **Follow up with Week 1 connections:** Send Day 3 follow-up (curiosity question) to accepted requests
- [ ] **Post 3x on LinkedIn with learnings:**
  - Post 4: Share surprising insight from discovery calls ("3/5 managers don't collect peer feedback because...")
  - Post 5: Customer testimonial or early win (even if beta/free)
  - Post 6: Poll or question ("How do you currently run peer reviews?")
- [ ] **Have 10 customer calls:** Mix of discovery (new prospects) and validation (show MVP wireframes to previous calls)
- [ ] **Update landing page copy:** Incorporate resonant phrases from calls, add FAQ section with top objections
- [ ] **Community contribution:** Post 1 meaty insight or template in Slack, DM 3-5 people offering help

### Week 4: Double Down or Pivot
- [ ] **Analyze what's working:**
  - Reply rate by message template (which opener worked best?)
  - Call show rate by source (LinkedIn vs community vs referral?)
  - Objections frequency (price, timing, already have solution?)
  - ICP refinement (are product managers more responsive than eng managers?)
- [ ] **Scale winning tactics 2x:**
  - If LinkedIn working: 50 connection requests this week
  - If community working: Join 2 more communities, double engagement
- [ ] **Kill what's not working:**
  - If posts get no engagement: Stop posting, focus on DMs
  - If wrong ICP: Pivot to better-fit personas (e.g., agency owners vs managers)
- [ ] **Document playbook:**
  - Best-performing connection request template
  - Objection handling responses that closed calls
  - ICP refinement (company size, role, industry)
- [ ] **Set Week 5-8 goals:**
  - Target: 15-20 qualified leads, 5-10 waitlist signups, 2-3 beta customers confirmed

## Budget Allocation

| Item | Monthly Cost | Expected Return |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| **LinkedIn Premium** | $50/month | Unlimited InMail, advanced search filters → 50+ quality connections/month |
| **Landing page hosting** | $10/month (Vercel/Netlify) | Professional presence for credibility |
| **Email marketing tool** | $0 (free tier: Mailchimp, ConvertKit) | 500 contacts = 50+ newsletter subscribers |
| **Calendar tool** | $0 (Calendly free tier) | Easy demo booking, reduces friction |
| **Community memberships** | $0 (free Slack/Discord) | 10-15 high-value conversations/month |
| **Total** | **$60/month** | **Target: 10-15 qualified leads/month** |

**Cost per qualified lead target:** $4-6 (if we hit 10-15 leads/month)

**Efficiency note:** Time is the bigger investment (8-10 hours/week) = founder sweat equity. Financial cost is minimal (<$100/month).

## Channel Experiments (After Month 1)

*Test these if primary channels plateau:*

### Experiment A: Cold Email to Agencies
- **Hypothesis:** Digital agencies (10-30 people) have higher pain because they bill clients hourly—wasted review time = lost revenue

- **Tactic:** Publish 5 high-value blog posts (1,500+ words each) with downloadable templates
- **Budget:** 10-15 hours writing + $0 hosting
- **Success criteria:** 100+ organic visits/month by Month 6, 5% email capture rate

### Experiment C: Partnerships with HR Tools
- **Hypothesis:** Managers using BambooHR/Rippling (basic HR tools) need performance add-on
