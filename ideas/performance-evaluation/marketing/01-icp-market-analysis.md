### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Pricing | Target | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------------|---------|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Lattice** | $11-16 PEPM | 100+ employees | Full HRIS, brand recognition | Expensive, complex, enterprise sales |
| **15Five** | $9-14 PEPM | 50+ employees | Weekly check-ins, engagement | Expensive, feature bloat |
| **Small Improvements** | $5-8 PEPM | 25+ employees | Simple, affordable | No peer feedback, basic features |
| **Culture Amp** | $10+ PEPM | 100+ employees | Analytics, surveys | Enterprise-only, complex |
| **Google Sheets** | Free | Any size | Free, familiar | No structure, chaos, no visibility |

### The Gap We Fill

```
Price ($PEPM)
$16 |                    [Lattice]
$14 |            [15Five]
$12 |
$10 |        [Culture Amp]
$8  |    [Small Improvements]  <-- Basic features only
$7  |    [US] <-- Enterprise features at SMB price
$6  |
$4  |
$0  |[Spreadsheets] <-- No features
    +---------------------------------> Features
         Basic    Self-Review  Peer    Goals   Analytics
                              Feedback
```

**Our Position:** Enterprise features (self-review + peer feedback + goals) at SMB pricing ($6-8 PEPM)

### Market Trends

**Tailwinds:**
1. **Remote/hybrid work** - Documentation more critical when managers don't see employees daily
2. **Legal awareness** - SMBs increasingly aware of termination liability without documented performance issues
3. **Tool consolidation** - Companies want fewer, more integrated tools
4. **Self-serve preference** - SMBs prefer trying tools before sales calls
5. **Performance culture** - Gen Z employees expect regular, documented feedback

**Headwinds:**
1. **Budget scrutiny** - Economic uncertainty = tighter SaaS budgets
2. **Tool fatigue** - "Another HR tool?" resistance
3. **Change resistance** - "Spreadsheets work fine" inertia
4. **Enterprise down-market** - Lattice launching SMB tier eventually

## Buying Process

### Decision Makers vs. Influencers

| Role | Involvement | Concerns | Win Them By |
|------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Hiring Manager** (Decision Maker) | Evaluates, implements, approves | Time savings, ease of use | Demo focused on their workflow |

### Typical Buying Journey

1. **Trigger** (Week 0): Painful review cycle or compliance scare
2. **Research** (Week 1-2): Google "performance review software small teams", ask peers
3. **Shortlist** (Week 2-3): Compare 3-4 tools, check pricing pages
4. **Trial** (Week 3-4): Start free trial with small team or mock data
5. **Evaluate** (Week 4-5): Run one review cycle or test features
6. **Decide** (Week 5-6): Present to CEO/finance if needed
7. **Purchase** (Week 6-8): Monthly to start, annual after 3-6 months

**Sales Cycle:** 4-8 weeks (shorter for manager-only decisions)

- Companies using modern stack (Slack + Notion + Linear)

### Tier 2: Good Fit (Contact Second)

- Product managers and ops leads at similar companies
- HR generalists at professional services firms
- Managers in companies that recently went remote-first
- Founders of 15-30 person companies

### Tier 3: Nurture (Content Marketing)

- Managers at <15 person companies (not ready yet)
- Companies with existing performance tools (wait for renewal frustration)
- Managers who engage with content but don't respond to outreach

## Key Insights for Other Agents

**For Product Manager:**
- MVP must nail: self-review with gap analysis, peer feedback aggregation
- Template library is table stakes - need role/level specific
- Mobile experience matters for employee adoption

**For Sales Manager:**
- Lead with time savings (30 min/review) and legal protection
- Discovery must uncover: current process, team size, budget authority
- Qualify hard on company size (15-50 sweet spot)

**For Marketing Manager (self):**
- LinkedIn is primary channel - managers are active there
- Content themes: "performance review templates", "small team management"
- Product Hunt launch after beta proves value
