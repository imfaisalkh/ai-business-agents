# ICP & Market Analysis

## Ideal Customer Profile

### Primary ICP
- **Job Title:** Engineering Manager, Product Manager, Operations Manager (first-time managers with 4-8 direct reports)
- **Company Size:** 15-50 employees (sweet spot), expanding to 5-100 employees
- **Industry:** Tech startups, digital agencies, SaaS companies, professional services firms
- **Budget Authority:** Yes - typically controls team budget of $5-20K/year for tools
- **Tech Savviness:** High - comfortable with SaaS tools, expects modern UX

### Psychographics
- **Daily frustrations:**
  - Drowning in 1:1s with no structure or documentation
  - Copy-pasting last quarter's review docs, feeling unprofessional
  - Anxiety about missing legal documentation for terminations
  - Guilt about inconsistent feedback across team members (recency bias)
  - Imposter syndrome: "Am I doing this right?"

- **Goals they're measured on:**
  - Team retention and engagement scores
  - Team productivity and velocity
  - Developing direct reports (succession planning)
  - Reducing time-to-productivity for new hires

- **Tools they already use:**
  - Slack/Teams for communication
  - Jira/Linear for project management
  - Google Workspace (Docs/Sheets for current reviews)
  - 1:1 meeting tools (Fellow, Soapbox)
  - Maybe: BambooHR or Rippling for basic HR

### Where to Find Them (Critical for Distribution)
| Channel | Specific Places |
|---------|-----------------|
| **LinkedIn** | #engineeringmanager #productmanagement #firsttimemanager hashtags; follow Lara Hogan, Julie Zhuo, Will Larson; active in "Engineering Managers" and "People Management" groups |
| **Communities** | Rands Leadership Slack, Manager's Club Slack, Eng Manager Hub Discord, /r/ExperiencedDevs and /r/managers on Reddit |
| **Publications** | Read "The Skip Level" newsletter, Manager Tools podcast, "Software Lead Weekly", Lenny's Newsletter, First Round Review |
| **Events** | LeadDev conferences, local engineering manager meetups, startup CTO/VP Eng dinners, SaaStr |

### Trigger Events (What Makes Them Search)
*When do they actively look for a solution?*
1. **Company hits 15-20 employees** - CEO says "we need formal reviews now" (90 days before review cycle)
2. **First termination goes badly** - realize they have no documentation trail, legal exposure
3. **New quarter starts** - copy-pasting last quarter's review docs, feel embarrassed by the mess
4. **Employee complains about lack of feedback** - exit interview or engagement survey exposes problem
5. **Promoted to manager** - suddenly responsible for 5-8 people, no idea how to do reviews

### Qualifying Questions
1. "How are you currently handling performance reviews for your team?" (Confirms they have the problem)
2. "What's your budget for team management tools - do you expense tools like Linear or Notion?" (Confirms budget authority)
3. "When's your next review cycle?" (Confirms urgency - ideal if <90 days away)

## Market Size (Bottom-Up)

### Total Addressable Market
- **US companies with 5-100 employees:** ~600,000 companies
- **Managers per company (avg):** 3-8 managers (assume 5)
- **Total managers:** ~3 million managers
- **Employees per manager:** 6-8 (assume 7)
- **Total employees:** ~21 million employees

### Realistic Addressable Market
- **Tech-savvy companies (20% of total):** 120,000 companies
- **Active buyers (those who care about performance tools):** 10% = 12,000 companies
- **Average team size:** 25 employees
- **Potential annual revenue:** 12,000 × 25 × $7/month × 12 = $25M ARR potential

### Reachable in Year 1
- **LinkedIn + community outreach:** Can reach ~2,000 qualified ICPs
- **Realistic conversion (trial → paid):** 2-5% = 40-100 companies
- **Year 1 revenue potential:** 70 companies × 20 employees × $7 × 12 = $117,600 ARR

**Source/reasoning:**
- Company counts from US Census Bureau small business data
- Tech-savvy filter based on SaaS adoption rates (G2, Gartner data)
- Conversion assumptions based on similar B2B SaaS benchmarks (ChartMogul, OpenView)

## Competitive Context
*For detailed competitor analysis, see `product/01-market-research.md`*

**Key positioning gaps we exploit:**
1. **Price gap:** Enterprise tools (Lattice $11-16 PEPM, 15Five $8-12 PEPM, Culture Amp $10-14 PEPM) ignore teams <50 employees; basic tools (Small Improvements $5-8 PEPM, 7Geese $5-7 PEPM) lack self-review and peer feedback. We fill the $6-8 PEPM gap with enterprise features.

2. **Feature gap:** Basic tools lack employee self-review and manager gap analysis (the "side-by-side comparison" that makes reviews actionable). We're one of the few at SMB price point with this.

3. **UX gap:** Enterprise tools require 1-2 weeks of setup, onboarding training, and admin hand-holding. We offer instant setup with pre-built templates (Software Engineer, Manager, Sales Rep).

4. **Market timing:** COVID accelerated remote work → async feedback is now expected; Gen Z/Millennials demand continuous feedback; manager training is scarce → tools need to guide managers through the process.

## Market Timing

**Why now?**
- **Remote work normalization:** Post-COVID, companies need structured async feedback tools (can't rely on hallway conversations)
- **Manager skill gap:** 60% of managers get no training (Gallup) → tools must educate AND execute
- **Employee expectations shifted:** Gen Z/Millennials expect continuous feedback, not annual reviews
- **Economic pressure:** 2023-2024 belt-tightening → companies scrutinizing $11-16 PEPM tools, open to cheaper alternatives
- **Tech enablement:** Modern frontend stacks (Vue, Nuxt) enable beautiful UX at lower cost → can match enterprise UX without enterprise budget

**Risks/headwinds:**
- **Economic recession:** If budgets freeze, tools with longer sales cycles (3-6 months) will struggle. Mitigation: Self-service, fast time-to-value.
- **Competitive response:** Lattice/15Five could launch SMB tier. Mitigation: Move fast, own the niche before they notice.
- **Low willingness to pay:** If managers say "Google Docs is fine", category doesn't exist yet. Mitigation: Validate in first 50 conversations.
- **Fragmented ICP:** If team managers in different industries have wildly different needs, hard to focus. Mitigation: Start with tech/agencies, expand later.
