### Trigger Events (What Makes Them Search)

*When do they actively look for a solution?*

1. **Just promoted to manager:** First-time managers with 4-8 direct reports who need to run reviews for the first time and feel unprepared
2. **Team grew past 10 employees:** Informal feedback breaks down, company needs documented processes, often triggered by board/investor pressure
3. **Review season approaching (Q4/Q1):** Managers dread the upcoming chaos and search for tools 2-4 weeks before cycle starts
4. **Bad experience with expensive tool:** Company tried Lattice/15Five, found it too expensive or complex, looking for simpler alternative
5. **Post-acquisition/funding:** Investors or acquirers asking about people processes and documentation

### Qualifying Questions

1. "How are you currently running performance reviews?" (Confirms problem exists and severity)
2. "What's your team size and growth trajectory?" (Confirms fit and expansion potential)
3. "What happened last review cycle that made you look for alternatives?" (Confirms urgency and pain)
4. "Who else would be involved in this decision?" (Confirms authority and sales complexity)
5. "What's your budget for people tools?" (Confirms ability to pay)

## Market Size (Bottom-Up)

### Calculation Method
- **Companies with 10-100 employees in US:** ~1.5 million
- **% with structured review processes:** ~40% = 600,000
- **% actively looking to upgrade/change:** ~15% = 90,000
- **Realistic addressable (tech-forward companies):** 30,000

### Market Value
- **30,000 companies x $1,500 ACV (25 employees x $5 PEPM x 12 months)** = $45M annual TAM
- **Realistic Year 1 target:** 50 customers = $75K-100K ARR

### Source/reasoning
- Bureau of Labor Statistics employer data
- LinkedIn company size filters
- Competitor public metrics (Lattice: 5,000+ customers, 15Five: 3,000+ customers)
- Pricing based on $6-8 PEPM target

### Market Landscape

| Tier | Players | Price Point | Target |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| Enterprise | Lattice, Culture Amp, 15Five | $11-16 PEPM | 100+ employees |
| Basic | Small Improvements, Leapsome | $5-8 PEPM | 50+ employees |
| Spreadsheet Alternatives | Google Forms, Notion templates | Free | 1-20 employees |
| **TeamPulse Opportunity** | None currently | $6-8 PEPM | 10-50 employees |

### Key Positioning Gaps We Exploit

1. **Price-Feature Gap:** Enterprise tools (Lattice, 15Five) cost $11-16 PEPM but include features SMBs don't need (OKR platforms, engagement surveys, complex analytics). Basic tools ($5 PEPM) lack critical features (self-review, peer feedback, gap analysis). TeamPulse fills the gap: enterprise features at SMB prices.

2. **Complexity Gap:** Enterprise tools require 1-2 weeks to set up, dedicated admin, manager training. Small teams don't have bandwidth for this. TeamPulse: 15-minute setup, intuitive UX, no training needed.

3. **Self-Review Gap:** Basic tools skip employee self-review and manager-vs-employee comparison. This is THE killer feature for coaching conversations. TeamPulse makes gap analysis the centerpiece.

4. **Visibility Gap:** In spreadsheet world, employees never see their reviews. Enterprise tools bury feedback in complex dashboards. TeamPulse: employees own their reviews, see feedback directly, track their own goals.

## Market Timing

### Why Now?

1. **Remote/hybrid work explosion:** Distributed teams need documented feedback more than ever. "Water cooler check-ins" don't work anymore.

2. **First-time manager cohort:** Millions promoted during 2020-2023 growth era, now running reviews for first time with zero training.

3. **Cost-cutting pressure:** 2024-2025 budget consciousness means companies dropping $15K/year Lattice contracts, looking for affordable alternatives.

4. **AI-powered competition:** Incumbents adding AI features but raising prices. Opportunity to offer AI-assisted reviews at fraction of cost.

5. **Legal liability awareness:** Companies burned by wrongful termination suits realize they need documentation. "We need reviews for legal protection" is growing buyer motivation.

### Risks/Headwinds

1. **Enterprise downmarket move:** Lattice/15Five could launch "lite" plans to capture SMB market
2. **HRIS bundling:** Gusto/Rippling/BambooHR adding performance features as loss leaders
3. **Economic downturn:** Small companies cutting all "nice to have" software during recession
4. **AI disruption:** ChatGPT/AI tools making review writing so easy that dedicated tools feel unnecessary

### Mitigation
- Move fast - establish brand before incumbents react
- Focus on workflow (not just templates) that AI can't easily replicate
- Position as "legal protection" and "retention tool" (must-have vs nice-to-have)
- Price low enough that cutting feels petty ($100/month vs $15K/year decision)
