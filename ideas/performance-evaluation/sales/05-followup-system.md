# Follow-Up System

## Follow-Up Philosophy

### The Rules

1. **Always have a next step** - Every interaction ends with a scheduled follow-up
2. **Follow up until you get a clear no** - Most sales are lost to indifference, not rejection
3. **Add value with every touch** - Don't just "check in" - share something useful
4. **Track everything** - If it's not in the CRM, it didn't happen
5. **Respect time** - Be persistent, not annoying

### Follow-Up Frequency by Stage

| Stage | Frequency | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Lead (pre-call) | Every 2-3 days | Book discovery call |
| Qualified (post-call) | Every 3-5 days | Start trial |
| Trial (active) | Day 1, 3, 7, 10, 13 | Drive activation |
| Opportunity | Every 2-3 days | Close deal |
| Stalled deal | Weekly → Bi-weekly → Monthly | Revive interest |

## Lead Follow-Up Sequence (Pre-Discovery)

### Goal: Book a discovery call

**Day 0: Initial Outreach**
[LinkedIn connection request - see LinkedIn Outreach artifact]

**Day 2: First Follow-Up**
> Hey [Name], wanted to bump this to the top of your inbox.
>
> Quick question: are you using spreadsheets for reviews, or do you have something more structured?

**Day 5: Value Add**
> Hey [Name], whether we chat or not, thought you might find this useful:
>
> [Link to free template or relevant blog post]
>
> Let me know if you'd like to chat about what you're doing for reviews.

**Day 9: Direct Ask**
> Hey [Name], I'll keep this short.
>
> Would a 15-minute call next week make sense? Happy to share what we're seeing work for teams your size.
>
> If not a fit, no worries - just let me know and I'll stop reaching out.

**Day 14: Final Attempt**
> Hey [Name], I'll take the hint :)
>
> If performance reviews ever become a priority, feel free to reach out. Here's my calendar if timing ever makes sense: [link]
>
> Best of luck with everything at [Company].

## Trial Follow-Up Sequence

### Goal: Drive activation and conversion

**Day 0: Welcome Email**

Subject: Welcome to [Product] - Here's your quick start

> Hey [Name],
>
> Welcome to [Product]! Excited to have you on board.
>
> **Quick Start (15 minutes):**
> 1. Add 3-4 team members: [link]
> 2. Pick a template: [link]
> 3. Create a test review cycle: [link]
>
> That's when the magic happens - you'll see how self-reviews and gap analysis work together.
>
> Questions? Just reply to this email. I'm here to help.
>
> [Signature]

---

**Day 2: Check-In**

Subject: Quick check-in - How's setup going?

> Hey [Name],
>
> Just checking in - did you get a chance to add your team?
>
> If you ran into any issues or questions, let me know. Happy to hop on a quick call to walk through anything.
>
> [Signature]

---

**Day 5: Progress + Value**

Subject: [Name], how's the trial going?

> Hey [Name],
>
> Checking in on your trial.
>
> [If they've added team]: Great to see you've added your team! Have you had a chance to create a review cycle?
>
> [If they haven't added team]: I noticed you haven't added any team members yet. Want me to walk you through the setup? Takes about 10 minutes.
>
> Here's a quick tip: The gap analysis feature is where most managers have their "aha" moment. You'll see how employees rate themselves vs. your ratings - it makes 1:1 conversations so much more productive.
>
> [Signature]

---

**Day 7: Feature Highlight**

Subject: Try the gap analysis feature

> Hey [Name],
>
> One feature I want to make sure you see: the gap analysis view.
>
> Here's how it works:
> 1. Employee rates themselves (self-review)
> 2. You rate them (manager review)
> 3. You see both side by side with gaps highlighted
>
> Most managers tell us this is the most valuable part - it surfaces coaching opportunities you'd never see otherwise.
>
> Have you gotten a chance to try it? Happy to show you in a quick call.
>

>
> If so, I can answer any questions about pricing or walk you through the upgrade process. For your team of [X], that's $[Y]/month.
>
> If not, I'd love to hear what's missing or what we could do better. Either way, happy to chat.
>
> [Calendly link]
>
> [Signature]

**Day 13: Last Day Warning**

Subject: Trial ending tomorrow - questions?

> Hey [Name],
>
> Your trial ends tomorrow.
