# Follow-Up System

## Follow-Up Philosophy
- **Persistence beats talent:** 80% of sales require 5+ follow-ups
- **Add value every time:** Don't just "check in"—share insight, template, or customer story
- **Know when to quit:** 3 no-replies = move to long-term nurture

---

## Follow-Up Cadence by Stage

### Stage 1: Post-Connection (LinkedIn)
*See marketing/04-linkedin-outreach.md for full sequence*

- **Day 1:** Value-first message (insight, no pitch)
- **Day 3:** Curiosity question (soft discovery)
- **Day 7:** Demo offer (if engaged)
- **Day 14:** Breakup email (if no response)

---

### Stage 2: Post-Discovery Call

#### Path A: Qualified → Demo Scheduled
- **Within 2 hours:** Send calendar invite + pre-demo email (see sales/07-scripts-library.md)
- **1 day before demo:** Confirmation + "What questions do you have?"
- **If no-show:** Immediate follow-up ("Missed you! Want to reschedule?")

#### Path B: Qualified → No Demo Scheduled Yet
- **Within 2 hours:** Send availability + value reminder
- **Day 3:** "Still interested? Here are 3 times that work for me"
- **Day 7:** Breakup ("Don't want to be a pest—ping me when timing's better")

#### Path C: Not Qualified → Nurture
- **Within 24 hours:** Thank you + free resources (templates, blog post)
- **Month 3:** Check-in ("Circling back—any changes?")
- **Month 6:** Another check-in or remove from list

---

### Stage 3: Post-Demo

#### Path A: Demo → Trial Signup (Success!)
- **Immediate:** Trial signup link + "Setup takes 15 min—ping me if stuck"
- **Day 3:** Check-in ("How's it going? Need help importing your team?")
- **Day 7:** Value reinforcement ("Halfway through trial—seen the gap analysis feature yet?")
- **Day 12:** Upgrade prompt ("Trial ends in 2 days—ready to upgrade?")
- **Day 14:** Final nudge ("Last day of trial—$6-8 PEPM, takes 2 min to upgrade: [link]")
- **Day 15:** If no conversion, ask why ("What would've made this a yes?")

#### Path B: Demo → "Let Me Think"
- **Within 2 hours:** "No pressure—what specifically are you thinking about?"
- **Day 3:** Address their concern + customer story ("Manager at [company] had same question—here's how they solved it")
- **Day 7:** "Ready to try the trial, or still thinking?"
- **Day 14:** Breakup ("No worries—I'll check back in [X] months before your next review cycle")

#### Path C: Demo → No Response (Ghost)
- **Day 1:** "How'd the demo land? Questions?"
- **Day 3:** "Haven't heard back—still interested or bad timing?"
- **Day 7:** Breakup ("Guessing this isn't a priority—I'll check in [X] months from now")

### Stage 4: Trial Active (Nurture to Conversion)

**Email sequence (automated or manual):**

**Day 0 (Signup):**
Subject: "Welcome to TeamPulse! Here's how to get started"
> Hey [Name]!
>
> Your trial is active. Here's how to set up in 15 minutes:
> 1. Import team (Slack or CSV): [link]
> 2. Pick template (Engineer, Manager, Sales): [link]
> 3. Launch first review: [link]
>
> I'll check in on Day 3 to see how it's going. Hit reply if you get stuck!
>
> [Your Name]

**Day 3 (Check-In):**
Subject: "How's your trial going?"
> Hey [Name],
>
> Quick check-in—have you had a chance to import your team and launch a review?
>
> If you're stuck, I'm happy to hop on a 10-min call and walk you through it.
>
> [Your Name]

**Day 7 (Value Reinforcement):**
Subject: "Halfway through your trial—have you seen the gap analysis?"
> Hey [Name],
>
> You're halfway through your trial! If you haven't tried the gap analysis feature yet, that's where the magic happens.
>
> Here's how: Have an employee submit their self-review, then open the "Gap Analysis" view. You'll see your ratings side-by-side with theirs. Managers tell us this saves 30 min per review.
>
> Let me know if you want a quick demo of that feature!
>
> [Your Name]

**Day 12 (Upgrade Prompt):**
Subject: "Your trial ends in 2 days—ready to upgrade?"
> Hey [Name],
>
> Your trial ends on [Date]. If you're seeing value, upgrading takes 2 minutes: [Upgrade link]
>
> Pricing reminder:
> - 20 employees: $120/month or $1,020/year (15% off annual)
> - All features included
>
> Questions? Hit reply or book a quick call: [Calendly link]
>
> [Your Name]

**Day 14 (Final Nudge):**
Subject: "Last day of your trial"
> Hey [Name],
>
> Today's the last day of your trial. If you want to keep using TeamPulse, upgrade here: [link]
>
> If the timing's not right, no worries—I'll check in before your next review cycle.
>
> [Your Name]

**Day 15 (If No Conversion):**
Subject: "What would've made this a yes?"
> Hey [Name],
>
> Noticed you didn't upgrade—totally fine! Can I ask what would've made this a yes? Was it pricing, features, timing, or something else?
>
> Your feedback helps us improve. Thanks!
>
> [Your Name]

---

### Stage 5: Closed-Lost (Long-Term Nurture)

**Goal:** Stay top-of-mind without being annoying

**Month 3:** "Checking in—how are reviews going?"
> Hey [Name],
>
> It's been a few months since we last chatted. Curious—how are performance reviews going? Still using [Google Docs / Lattice / etc.]?
>
> We've shipped some new features since then (historical review access, custom templates). If timing's better now, happy to show you. If not, I'll check back in another few months.
>
> [Your Name]

**Month 6:** "Before your next review cycle..."
> Hey [Name],
>
> Your next review cycle is probably coming up in the next 60-90 days. Want to avoid the copy-paste chaos this time?
>
> We can get you set up in 15 minutes. Let me know if you want a quick demo.
>
> [Your Name]

**Month 12:** Final check-in or remove
> Hey [Name],
>
> Last check-in! If performance reviews still aren't a priority, I'll stop bothering you. But if anything's changed, I'm here.
>
> [Your Name]

## Follow-Up Tracking (Notion/Airtable Template)

| Lead Name | Stage | Last Touch | Next Action | Next Touch Date | Notes |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| Sarah Chen | Trial Active | Day 3 check-in sent | Day 7 value email | Jan 30 | Imported team, launched 1 review |
| Alex Kim | Post-Demo | Demo done, no signup | Follow-up #2 | Jan 28 | Said "let me think", concerned about pricing |
| Jordan Lee | Nurture | Month 3 check-in | Month 6 check-in | Apr 15 | Next review cycle in May |

## Follow-Up Rules of Thumb

1. **Always add value:** Don't say "just checking in"—share customer story, free template, or new feature
2. **Respect the breakup:** After 3 no-replies, move to long-term nurture (don't spam)
3. **Track everything:** Use CRM/Notion to avoid awkward "did I already follow up?" moments
4. **Automate where possible:** Use email sequences for trial nurture (Day 0, 3, 7, 12, 14)
5. **Personalize the important ones:** Hot leads get custom emails, cold leads get templates

## Follow-Up Mistake to Avoid

❌ **"Just checking in"** → Adds no value, easy to ignore
✅ **"Saw your team is hiring—reviews about to get more complex. Ready to set up TeamPulse before it's chaos?"** → Personalized, value-driven

❌ **"Did you see my last email?"** → Guilt-tripping, annoying
✅ **"In case you missed it—here's a free review template I thought you'd find useful: [link]"** → Helpful, assumes best intent

❌ **"Let me know if you're interested"** → Puts onus on them, vague
✅ **"Want to hop on a 10-min call Thursday at 2pm to discuss? Here's my calendar: [link]"** → Specific, actionable
