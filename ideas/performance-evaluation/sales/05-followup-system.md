# Follow-Up System

> **Purpose:** Systematic follow-up sequences for different sales stages. Never let a lead go cold through neglect.
>
> **Fits in:** Use after discovery calls, demos, and during trials. Complements Sales Process (01) and Objection Handling (04).

## Follow-Up Philosophy

**Core principles:**
1. **Speed wins** - First response within 2 hours during business hours
2. **Persistence pays** - 80% of sales require 5+ touches; most salespeople stop at 2
3. **Value every touch** - Every follow-up should add value, not just "checking in"
4. **Know when to stop** - After 7+ touches with no response, move to long-term nurture
