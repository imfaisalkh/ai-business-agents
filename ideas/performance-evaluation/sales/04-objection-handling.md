# Objection Handling Playbook

## Framework: Listen → Validate → Reframe → Close

1. **Listen:** Let them finish, don't interrupt
2. **Validate:** "I hear you—that's a fair concern"
3. **Reframe:** Address root cause with data/story
4. **Close:** Ask for next step

## Top 10 Objections & Responses

### 1. "Too expensive—we're bootstrapped"

**Listen:** "I get it—budget is tight."

**Validate:** "A lot of teams we work with are bootstrapped too."

**Reframe:**
"Let's look at ROI. You're spending 2-4 hours per review × 10 people = 20-40 hours per quarter = 80-160 hours/year. At your hourly rate ($50-100), that's $4K-16K in opportunity cost. We cost $720-1,440/year—you're actually saving money by NOT using Google Docs."

**Close:** "Does that ROI make sense? Want to try the 14-day trial and measure the time savings yourself?"

---

### 2. "We already use Lattice/15Five"

**Listen:** "Got it—you've already invested in a tool."

**Validate:** "Lattice is great for enterprises. Can I ask—do you use their peer feedback and gap analysis features?"

**Reframe (if NO):**
"So you're paying $11-16 per person for features you're not using. We focus exclusively on performance reviews (self-review, gap analysis, peer feedback, goals). You'd save $5-10 per person—that's $1,200-2,400/year for a 20-person team. Same features you actually use, half the cost."

**Reframe (if YES):**
"Fair—if you're using all of Lattice's features, we're probably not the right fit. But if your team is <50 people and you're only using reviews, worth comparing. Want to see our gap analysis feature side-by-side?"

**Close:** "Would it make sense to run a pilot with 5 people and compare?"

---

### 3. "Not a priority right now"

**Listen:** "Totally fair—you've got a lot on your plate."

**Validate:** "Reviews often fall to the bottom of the list."

**Reframe:**
"Quick question—when's your next review cycle? If it's <90 days away, you'll be copy-pasting docs again. What if we set this up in 15 minutes today, so you don't have to think about it until then?"

**Alternative reframe:**
"What would make this a priority? Usually it's one of three things: employee complained about lack of feedback, termination with no documentation, or new quarter starting. Have any of those happened recently?"

**Close:** "Want to hop on the waitlist and I'll ping you 60 days before your next cycle?"

---

### 4. "Google Docs works fine for us"

**Listen:** "Makes sense—Docs is flexible and free."

**Validate:** "Lots of teams start with Docs. We did too."

**Reframe:**
"Can I ask—do your employees see their self-review ratings next to yours before the 1:1? Do you have historical review data for promotion decisions? Is peer feedback anonymized automatically?"

*[Wait for NO to at least one]*

"Those gaps become painful around 15-20 employees. That's when managers tell us Docs stops working. You're at [X] people now—have you felt that pain yet?"

**Close:** "Want to try us for one review cycle and compare? If Docs is still better, no hard feelings."

---

### 5. "I need to talk to my team first"

**Listen:** "Of course—team buy-in is important."

**Validate (but probe for real objection):**
"What specifically do you want their input on? Pricing? Features? Workflow?"

*[They'll reveal the real objection—price, authority, or uncertainty]*

**Reframe (if authority issue):**
"Got it. Are you the decision maker, or does someone else need to approve?"

**Reframe (if feature concern):**
"Makes sense. What if I send you a trial link—you can test it with 2-3 people on your team, get their feedback, then decide?"

**Close:** "Does a 3-person pilot make sense, or do you need to involve your whole team?"

---

### 6. "We only do reviews once a year—not worth it"

**Listen:** "Annual reviews—that's a long gap."

**Validate:** "Lots of companies do annual reviews."

**Reframe:**
"Even if you only review once a year, you're still spending 2-4 hours per person. For a 20-person team, that's 40-80 hours once a year = ~$2K-4K in time cost. We cost $1,440/year and save you half that time. You're still cash-flow positive."

**Alternative reframe:**
"Plus, annual reviews mean documentation matters even more—if you need to terminate someone, having a paper trail from the last review is critical. We store history automatically."

**Close:** "Want to try it for your next annual cycle and measure the time savings?"

---

### 7. "Seems complex to set up"

**Listen:** "I hear you—setup can be a blocker."

**Validate:** "That's exactly why we built this. Lattice takes 1-2 weeks to set up."

**Reframe:**
"Our setup is 15 minutes: Import team from Slack or CSV, pick a template (Engineer, Manager, Sales), send requests. No training, no onboarding calls. I can walk you through it on this call if you want—literally takes less time than this conversation."

**Close:** "Want to screen share right now and I'll help you set it up in 10 minutes?"

---

### 8. "What if employees don't fill out self-reviews?"

**Listen:** "That's a valid concern—adoption is key."

**Validate:** "We see 80%+ self-review completion rates with our customers."

**Reframe:**
"Two things drive completion: (1) Email + Slack reminders (we send 3, 1, and 0 days before deadline), and (2) employees see value—they know their self-review is part of the conversation, not just a formality. In beta, managers who explained 'I want to see your perspective first' got 90%+ completion."

**Close:** "Want to try it with your team and see? We'll send you completion rate data after the first cycle."

---

### 9. "We need [enterprise feature X] first" (SSO, SAML, API)

**Listen:** "Got it—[feature X] is important for you."

**Validate:** "That's on our roadmap for [timeline]."

**Reframe (if <100 employees):**
"Can I ask—is [feature X] a hard blocker, or a nice-to-have? Most teams your size (50 people) use email/password + Google OAuth. Would that work for now, and we can add [feature X] in [3-6 months]?"

**Reframe (if >100 employees):**
"For enterprise teams, we have a custom plan with [feature X] included. Let me connect you with our enterprise team—they can scope timeline and pricing. Does [X] weeks work?"

**Close:** "Want to start with Starter plan now and upgrade to Enterprise when [feature X] is ready?"

---

### 10. "Let me think about it"

**Listen:** "Of course—no pressure."

**Validate (but uncover real objection):**
"Totally fair. Can I ask—what specifically do you need to think about? Is it pricing, features, timing, or something else?"

*[They'll reveal the real objection—handle it using above scripts]*

**Reframe (if stalling):**
"I hear you. Here's what I'll do—I'll send you a 14-day trial link. No credit card required. You can test it with your team, and if it doesn't work, no hard feelings. Sound fair?"

**Close:** "Does it make sense to try it during your next review cycle, or would you rather wait until [next quarter]?"

---

## Objection Patterns (When to Walk Away)

### Red Flag Objections (Politely Exit)
- **"We're happy with [current solution]" + no pain expressed** → Not a fit, nurture for 6-12 months
- **"I need to check with [boss/team]" after 3+ follow-ups** → No authority, disqualify
- **"Maybe in 12 months"** → No urgency, add to long-term nurture
- **"Can you build [custom feature]?"** → Wrong fit (too small for custom dev), suggest Enterprise plan or exit

### Objection as Buying Signal
Sometimes objections mean "I'm interested but need reassurance":
- **"Too expensive"** → They're considering it (give ROI data)
- **"Not sure about [feature]"** → They're evaluating deeply (demo the feature)
- **"We use [competitor]"** → They're open to switching (show differentiation)

**Rule of thumb:** If they ask 3+ questions or raise 2+ objections, they're engaged. Keep selling.

## Objection Handling Cheat Sheet (Print This)

| Objection | Quick Response |
|-----------|----------------|
| "Too expensive" | "ROI: 30 min/review savings × 10 people = 20 hrs/year = $1K value for $720/year" |

| "Not a priority" | "When's your next cycle? Let's set up in 15 min today so you're ready." |
| "Docs works" | "Do employees see self-review gaps? Have historical data? Peer feedback anonymized?" |
| "Need team buy-in" | "3-person pilot first, then expand?" |
| "Annual reviews" | "Even 1x/year = 40-80 hours for 20 people. We save half that time + store history." |
| "Seems complex" | "15 min setup—I can walk you through it right now." |
| "Low adoption risk" | "80%+ completion rate in beta—email + Slack reminders + employees see value." |
| "Need SSO/SAML" | "Roadmap for [timeline]. Email/Google OAuth work for now?" |
| "Let me think" | "What specifically? Pricing, features, timing? Let's address it now." |
