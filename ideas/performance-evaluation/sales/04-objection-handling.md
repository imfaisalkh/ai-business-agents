# Objection Handling Playbook

> **Purpose:** Responses to common objections when selling TeamPulse. Turn objections into opportunities to understand and address concerns.
>
> **Fits in:** Use during discovery calls, demos, and closing conversations. Practice until responses feel natural.

## Objection Handling Framework

### The LAER Method

1. **Listen** - Let them finish, don't interrupt
2. **Acknowledge** - Show you understand their concern
3. **Explore** - Ask clarifying questions to understand the real issue
4. **Respond** - Address with appropriate response

**Never:**
- Get defensive
- Dismiss their concern
- Rush to answer without understanding
- Argue or push back aggressively

---

## Price Objections

### "It's too expensive"

**Explore first:**
> "Help me understand - too expensive compared to what? Your current solution, or other tools you've looked at?"

**Response A: Compared to competitors**
> "Fair question. Lattice charges $11+ per employee - we're about half that. And unlike Small Improvements at $5, we include the self-review gap analysis that makes reviews actually useful. What features matter most to you?"

**Response B: Compared to free (spreadsheets)**
> "Totally get it - free is hard to beat. Let me ask: how much time do you spend on reviews each quarter? [Wait for answer] At $50/hour manager time, that's $[X]. TeamPulse costs $[Y]/month but saves you 30+ minutes per review. For 10 reviews, that's 5 hours saved. It pays for itself in the first cycle."

**Response C: General too expensive**
> "What would make it feel like good value? Is it the price point, or is it that you're not sure it'll solve the problem well enough?"

---

### "We don't have budget for this"

**Explore first:**
> "Understood. Is it that there's no budget at all, or that budget wasn't allocated for this specific need?"

**Response A: No budget allocated**
> "Makes sense - most teams don't have a line item for 'performance review software.' In your experience, when something saves significant time and reduces risk, how have you found budget before? Is this something you could present as solving a specific problem?"

**Response B: Budget freeze**
> "Got it, budget cycles are tough. When does your next budget period start? Should we reconnect then? In the meantime, I can send you some resources to help with your current process."

**Response C: Reframe value**
> "Let me ask this: if TeamPulse prevents one surprise resignation - which typically costs $50K+ to replace - would $1,500/year feel justified? Or if it prevents a wrongful termination lawsuit - which averages $40K - does that change the math?"

---

### "Can we get a discount?"

**Explore first:**
> "Happy to discuss. What would make this work for you?"

**Response A: If early stage or legitimate constraint**
> "We have an early bird rate at $6/employee for our first 50 customers. You'd get that locked in permanently. Does that work?"

**Response B: If just negotiating**
> "Our pricing is already positioned well below Lattice and 15Five. What I can offer is 25% off if you commit to an annual plan. That brings it to $[X]/month."

**Response C: If not justified**
> "I understand wanting the best deal. Here's my challenge: we're already priced 50% below the enterprise tools. If I discount further, I'm not sure we can deliver the support and product quality you'd expect. What if we focus on making sure this is the right fit first?"

---

## Timing Objections

### "Not a priority right now"

**Explore first:**
> "That makes sense - priorities shift. What's taking precedence right now? And when would this move up the list?"

**Response A: If reviews are coming**
> "When's your next review cycle? The teams I talk to often wish they'd started earlier - the 2-week scramble is real. What if we set something up now so you're ready when it matters?"

**Response B: If genuinely not a priority**
> "Totally fair. Can I ask what would make this a priority? A bad review experience? Team growth? Compliance pressure? That way, I can check back when it's relevant."

**Response C: Create gentle urgency**
> "Understood. Quick thought: the companies that have reviews figured out tend to retain their best people better. If retention matters to you, this might be more urgent than it seems. Either way, let me send you a resource that might help whenever you're ready."

---

### "We're evaluating other options"

**Explore first:**
> "Smart to compare options. What other tools are you looking at? And what criteria are most important to you?"

**Response:**
> "Great - competition keeps us sharp. Here's what I'd focus on when comparing: [1] Does it have self-review with gap analysis? That's our differentiator. [2] What's the actual price per employee? [3] How long does setup take? We're typically up and running in 15 minutes.

> After you've seen the others, I'd love to hear how we stack up. Can we schedule a quick call after you've demoed [competitor]?"

---

### "We just implemented something else"

**Explore first:**
> "Ah, timing. What did you go with? How's it working so far?"

**Response:**
> "Got it - switching costs are real and I'm not here to sell you something you don't need. If you're happy with [competitor], stick with it.

> That said, if you run into issues - especially around self-review or gap analysis, which [competitor] doesn't do well - keep us in mind. Should I check back in 6 months?"

---

## Feature Objections

### "We need integrations with [HRIS/Slack/etc.]"

**Explore first:**
> "Which integrations are must-haves versus nice-to-haves? What would you use the integration for?"

**Response A: If it's on our roadmap**
> "[Integration] is on our roadmap for Q[X]. In the meantime, we have CSV export/import that works with most HRIS systems. Would that bridge the gap, or is native integration a deal-breaker?"

**Response B: If it's not planned**
> "We don't have that integration today, and I want to be honest that it's not on our near-term roadmap. Our focus is on making reviews amazing, not becoming an integration platform. If that's a must-have, we might not be the right fit right now."

---

### "We need [feature we don't have]"

**Explore first:**
> "Tell me more about how you'd use [feature]. What problem does it solve for you?"

**Response A: If it's actually not needed**
> "I hear that a lot. Interestingly, when I dig in, teams usually realize they don't actually use [feature] that much - it's more of a checkbox. Can you tell me about the last time you used [feature] in your current process?"

**Response B: If we're building it**
> "That's on our roadmap for [timeframe]. We're building TeamPulse specifically for teams like yours, so that feedback is gold. Would you be open to trying us now and getting early access when we ship it?"

**Response C: If we're not building it**
> "I appreciate the feedback. That's not something we're planning to build - we're focused on doing reviews really well rather than being everything to everyone. If [feature] is a must-have, [competitor] might be a better fit for you."

---

### "It doesn't do enough / too simple"

**Explore first:**
> "What would 'enough' look like? What specifically do you need that you're not seeing?"

**Response:**
> "We intentionally don't have OKRs, engagement surveys, or weekly check-ins. Most teams under 50 employees don't need that stuff - it's complexity for complexity's sake.

> What we do is reviews, done really well: self-review, peer feedback, and gap analysis. If you need a full HR platform, we're probably not the right fit. If you need reviews that actually improve conversations, that's our sweet spot."

---

## Competitor Objections

### "Lattice/15Five does more"

**Response:**
> "They do - and they charge for it. Lattice is $11+ per employee and includes OKRs, engagement surveys, and features most small teams don't use.

> Question: of all the things Lattice does, which do you actually need? If it's reviews with self-assessment and peer feedback, we do that just as well at half the price. If you need OKRs and engagement surveys, Lattice might be the right call."

---

### "Small Improvements is cheaper"

**Response:**
> "They are - by about $1-2 per employee. But here's what you're not getting: proper self-review with gap analysis. With Small Improvements, you can't see a side-by-side comparison of how you rated someone versus how they rated themselves.

> That gap analysis is what transforms review conversations. It's the difference between you talking at someone for 30 minutes and having a focused coaching conversation. Is that worth an extra $20/month for your team?"

---

### "We're happy with spreadsheets"

**Response:**
> "Spreadsheets work! I'm not going to tell you they don't. The question is: at what team size do they break down?

> Here's what I hear from teams that switch: [1] Employees never see their reviews. [2] There's no historical tracking. [3] No self-review or 360. [4] Every quarter is copying from last quarter.

> If none of that bothers you, stick with spreadsheets. But if any of it resonates, that's exactly what we solve. Want me to send you a free template that might make spreadsheets work better, either way?"

---

## Trust/Risk Objections

### "You're a new/small company"

**Explore first:**
> "Fair concern. What specifically worries you about working with a smaller company?"

**Response:**
> "I get it - betting on a startup is a risk. Here's how I think about it:

> [1] We're laser-focused on this one thing. Lattice has 50 features they're maintaining. We have one product we're making excellent.
> [2] You'll get direct access to the founder (me) and influence over the roadmap.
> [3] Your data is portable - we'll never hold it hostage.
> [4] We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If it doesn't work, you're out nothing.

> What would make you comfortable enough to try?"

---

### "What if you shut down?"

**Response:**
> "Valid concern. A few things:

> [1] We're bootstrapped and profitable [or: path to profitability is clear], so we're not dependent on raising more money.
> [2] Your data is always exportable. If we ever did shut down, you'd have your review history.
> [3] Performance reviews aren't a 'sticky' category - you're not rebuilding years of data like you would with a CRM.

> Would a contractual data portability guarantee help?"

---

### "We need SOC 2 / enterprise security"

**Explore first:**
> "Is that a hard requirement from your security team, or is it a preference?"

**Response A: If hard requirement**
> "Understood. We're working toward SOC 2 Type II - expected completion in [timeframe]. If that's a blocker, I can follow up when we have it. In the meantime, I can share our security documentation."

**Response B: If preference**
> "We take security seriously - GDPR compliant, data encrypted at rest and in transit, hosted on AWS. We can share our full security documentation. For a team of [their size], is SOC 2 typically required, or would our current security posture work?"

---

## Authority Objections

### "I need to talk to my boss/HR/team"

**Explore first:**
> "Of course. What do you think they'll care most about? And is there anything I can provide to help you make the case?"

**Response:**
> "Happy to help. A few options:
> [1] I can send you a one-pager summarizing the value prop
> [2] I could do a quick call with you and [boss/HR] together
> [3] Want me to record a personalized 5-min Loom video for them?

> What would be most helpful for how your team makes decisions?"

---

### "Let me think about it"

**Explore first:**
> "Absolutely - it's a decision worth thinking through. Is there a specific concern holding you back, or is it more about timing?"

**Response:**
> "Totally fair. To help you think through it, here's what I'd consider:
> [1] When's your next review cycle? Will this be solved by then?
> [2] What's the cost of doing nothing for another quarter?
> [3] Is there something specific you're unsure about that I can address?

> Let me also send you [resource] - and let's set a specific time to reconnect. How about [date]?"

### Objection Log

Track objections you hear and responses that work:

| Date | Objection | Response Used | Outcome |
|------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

## Key Principles

1. **Objections are good** - They mean the prospect is engaged
2. **Listen first** - Understand the real objection before responding
3. **Don't argue** - You can't win an argument with a customer
4. **Be honest** - If it's not a fit, say so
5. **Always have a next step** - Even if it's "let's reconnect in 90 days"
