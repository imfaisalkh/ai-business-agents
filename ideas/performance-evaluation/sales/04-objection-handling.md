## Objection Handling Framework

### The Formula: Acknowledge → Clarify → Respond → Confirm

1. **Acknowledge** - Show you heard them and understand
2. **Clarify** - Make sure you understand the real concern
3. **Respond** - Address with relevant information
4. **Confirm** - Check if concern is resolved, move forward

---

## Price Objections

### "It's too expensive"

**Acknowledge:**
> "I hear you - no one wants to overspend on tools."

**Clarify:**
> "Help me understand - is it that the total cost is too high, or that you're comparing to something cheaper?"

**Respond (based on their answer):**

*If total cost:*
> "For your team of 25, that's $175/month. Consider that each review probably takes you 30+ minutes today. With 25 reviews per cycle, that's 12+ hours.
>
> At even $50/hour, that's $625 in time - and you'd be using this quarterly. The tool pays for itself in saved time in the first cycle."

*If comparing to cheaper:*
> "What are you comparing to? If it's a basic tool like Small Improvements, we're about the same price. The difference is we include self-review with gap analysis and peer feedback - features they don't have."

**Confirm:**
> "Does that help put the cost in perspective?"

### "We don't have budget for another tool"

**Acknowledge:**
> "I get it - tool spending adds up fast."

**Clarify:**
> "Is there truly no budget, or is it more that this hasn't been prioritized yet?"

**Respond:**

*If no budget at all:*
> "Understood. Let me share a free template that might help in the meantime. When budgets open up, I'd love to reconnect."

*If not prioritized:*
> "What would need to happen for this to become a priority? Is it about proving value first, or timing with review cycles?"

[Then work toward a pilot or wait for better timing]

**Confirm:**
> "Would a smaller pilot with just your team make this more feasible?"

### "Competitor X is cheaper"

**Acknowledge:**
> "Good to know you're comparing options."

**Clarify:**
> "Which tool are you looking at? I want to make sure we're comparing apples to apples."

**Respond (by competitor):**

*If Small Improvements ($5-8):*
> "They're great for basic reviews. The difference is we include self-review with gap analysis and peer feedback - features they charge extra for or don't have. For an extra $1-2 per person, you get a more complete 360 view."

*If spreadsheets (free):*
> "Spreadsheets are free, but think about your time. How many hours do you spend setting up forms, chasing responses, organizing files? Even 5 hours per cycle at your rate is worth more than our tool costs."

*If Lattice/15Five ($11-16):*
> "Actually, we're 40-50% cheaper than them. Same core features - self-review, peer feedback, goals - just without the enterprise bells and whistles."

**Confirm:**
> "Does that comparison help? What features are most important to you?"

### "Can you give us a discount?"

**Acknowledge:**
> "I appreciate you asking."

**Clarify:**
> "What would make this a yes for you? Is it the total price, or something else?"

**Respond:**

*Standard response:*
> "Our pricing is already 40-50% below enterprise tools. We keep it simple - same price for everyone, no complex negotiations.
>
> What I can offer is 15% off if you commit to annual - that saves you about $[X] over the year."

*If they push:*
> "Here's what I can do - if you sign up this week, I can lock you in at our early adopter rate: $6/employee instead of $7. That's the best I can do."

**Confirm:**
> "Would that work for you?"

---

## Competition Objections

### "We already use [Competitor]"

**Acknowledge:**
> "Good to know. How's that working for you?"

**Clarify:**
> "What made you take this call then? Is there something that's not working?"

**Respond (if they have pain with competitor):**

> "Sounds like [pain point] is frustrating. That's actually one of the main reasons people switch to us.
>
> We focus specifically on [their pain] - here's how it works differently..."

*If they're happy with competitor:*
> "Sounds like you've got a good setup. If that ever changes, keep us in mind. What would need to happen for you to consider switching?"

**Confirm:**
> "Is [pain point] significant enough to make a change?"

### "Lattice is the industry standard"

**Acknowledge:**
> "They're definitely well-known, especially with bigger companies."

**Clarify:**
> "Have you used Lattice, or is it more that you've heard of them?"

**Respond:**

> "Lattice is great for teams of 100+. For smaller teams like yours, you end up paying for a lot of features you'll never use - HRIS integrations, complex workflows, enterprise compliance.
>
> We focus on the 20% of features that 80% of managers actually need - self-reviews, peer feedback, gap analysis. At half the price.
>
> The question is: do you need enterprise features, or do you need something that works?"

**Confirm:**
> "What features are must-haves for you?"

### "What if you don't survive as a startup?"

**Acknowledge:**
> "That's a fair concern - you want something that'll be around."

**Clarify:**
> "Is that the main thing holding you back, or is there something else?"

**Respond:**

> "A few things:
>
> First, your data is always yours. You can export everything to CSV or PDF anytime - you're never locked in.
>
> Second, we're bootstrapped and profitable [or: we're building sustainably]. We're not chasing unsustainable growth that leads to shutdowns.
>
> Third, even if the worst happened, your historical reviews would be exported and you'd switch to something else. The data doesn't disappear."

**Confirm:**
> "Does that address your concern?"

---

## Timing Objections

### "We're not ready yet"

**Acknowledge:**
> "Timing is important - I don't want to push something you don't need yet."

**Clarify:**
> "What would make you ready? Is it a specific event, or just not a priority right now?"

**Respond:**

*If specific event:*
> "Got it. Let me reach out [timeframe before event] so you have time to evaluate. Would that work?"

*If not a priority:*
> "Understood. Just so I understand - is it that reviews are working fine, or that other things are more urgent?"

[If reviews are working fine, they may not be ICP - probe further or disqualify]

**Confirm:**
> "When's a good time for me to check back?"

### "Let me think about it"

**Acknowledge:**
> "Of course - I want you to make the right decision."

**Clarify:**
> "Totally reasonable. What specifically are you thinking through? I might be able to help."

**Respond (based on their answer):**

*If they reveal real concern:*
[Address that specific concern]

*If they're being polite:*
> "I understand. What would help you decide one way or the other? Is there info I can send, or would it help to see a specific feature?"

*If they're clearly not interested:*
> "I appreciate your time. Sounds like this isn't the right fit. If that changes, you know where to find us."

**Confirm:**
> "What's the one thing that would make this an easy yes?"

### "We need to wait until next quarter"

**Acknowledge:**
> "Makes sense - new quarter, new budget."

**Clarify:**
> "Is it a budget thing, or timing with your review cycles?"

**Respond:**

*If budget:*
> "Got it. Would it help to start the trial now so you're ready to go when budget opens up? No commitment, but you'd have evaluated it already."

*If timing:*
> "When does your next review cycle start? I'd want you to have at least a few weeks to set up and test before you're in the thick of it."

**Confirm:**
> "Can I reach out [specific date] to reconnect?"

### "We're too busy right now"

**Acknowledge:**
> "I totally understand - there's always something urgent."

**Clarify:**
> "Is it that you're busy right now, or that reviews specifically aren't a priority?"

**Respond:**

*If generally busy:*
> "The irony is, a tool like this saves you time during review season. Setting up takes about 30 minutes, and then each review takes half the time.
>
> Would it help to do a quick setup call so it's ready when you have bandwidth?"

*If reviews not priority:*
> "When do you think reviews will become more top-of-mind? I don't want to bug you until it makes sense."

**Confirm:**
> "Would a 15-minute setup call now save you time later?"

---

## Feature/Product Objections

### "We need [feature you don't have]"

**Acknowledge:**
> "Good to know that's important to you."

**Clarify:**
> "Help me understand - how would you use [feature]? What problem would it solve?"

**Respond:**

*If it's on our roadmap:*
> "That's actually on our roadmap for [timeframe]. In the meantime, [workaround or alternative]."

*If it's not planned:*
> "That's not something we have right now. Can you tell me more about why that's critical? I want to understand if it's a deal-breaker or a nice-to-have."

*If it's truly a deal-breaker:*
> "If that's a must-have, we might not be the right fit right now. [Competitor] has that feature if that's the priority."

**Confirm:**
> "Is [feature] a deal-breaker, or could you work without it?"

### "What about integrations with [tool]?"

**Acknowledge:**
> "Integrations are important for workflow."

**Clarify:**
> "What would you want the integration to do specifically?"

**Respond:**

*If Slack:*
> "We integrate with Slack for reminders and notifications. You can customize which alerts go to Slack."

*If HRIS (Gusto, Rippling, etc.):*
> "We don't have that integration yet. For now, you can import employees via CSV, which takes about 5 minutes. We're building HRIS integrations based on demand."

*If SSO:*
> "We support Google SSO. Other SSO providers are on the roadmap."

**Confirm:**
> "Would [what we have] work for now, or is [integration] a must-have?"

### "It seems complicated"

**Acknowledge:**
> "Last thing I want is another complicated tool to manage."

**Clarify:**
> "What part seems complicated? I want to make sure I'm explaining it clearly."

**Respond:**

> "It's actually designed to be simple. Here's the reality:
>
> 1. Setup takes 15-30 minutes - add your team, pick a template
> 2. Launch a review cycle - 5 clicks
> 3. Reviews come in automatically - you just review when they're done
>
> No training, no implementation project. Most managers are up and running same day."

**Confirm:**
> "Would you be open to trying the trial just to see how easy it is?"

---

## Trust/Risk Objections

### "How do I know this will work for us?"

**Acknowledge:**
> "You should have confidence before committing."

**Clarify:**
> "What would 'working' look like for your team?"

**Respond:**

> "Here's my suggestion: Start the free trial. Add 3-4 team members. Create one test review cycle.
>
> You'll see within a week if the workflow makes sense. If it doesn't, you've lost nothing but an hour of time."

**Confirm:**
> "Would trying it risk-free help you feel confident?"

### "What's the catch?"

**Acknowledge:**
> "Fair question - pricing is transparent in this industry."

**Clarify:**
> "What specifically are you worried about?"

**Respond:**

> "No catch. Price is $7/employee/month (or $6 annual). That includes everything - no hidden fees, no per-feature pricing, no implementation costs.
>
> You can cancel anytime. Your data is exportable. We don't do long-term contracts unless you want the annual discount."

**Confirm:**
> "Does that answer your concern?"

### "I've been burned by tools before"

**Acknowledge:**
> "Sorry to hear that - nothing worse than investing in something that doesn't deliver."

**Clarify:**
> "What happened? What tool was it?"

**Respond:**

> "That's exactly why we do a no-commitment trial. You can test it with your actual team, run a real review cycle, and decide after you've seen it work.
>
> If it doesn't deliver, you haven't spent a dollar."

**Confirm:**
> "Would a hands-on trial help you feel more confident before committing?"

## Handling Objections in Practice

### If you don't know the answer

> "That's a great question - I don't want to give you the wrong answer. Let me check and get back to you by [tomorrow/this afternoon]."

### If they keep objecting

After 3+ objections, pause:

> "It sounds like there might be something deeper here. Can I ask - what would need to be true for you to move forward?"

This often reveals the real blocker.

### If they won't give a straight answer

> "I want to be respectful of your time. It sounds like this might not be a fit right now - is that fair?"

Sometimes being direct helps them be direct.

---

## Objection Prevention

### Address objections before they come up

**On pricing (during demo):**
> "Before I forget - pricing is $7/employee. For your team, that's about $175/month. Just wanted to put that out there."

**On complexity (during demo):**
> "This is literally all you do to launch a review cycle. [Show simple flow]"

**On risk (when closing):**
> "Remember, it's a 14-day trial with no credit card. Worst case, you learn what you don't like."
