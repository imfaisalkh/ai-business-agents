## Discovery Call Scripts

### Opening (2 min)

> "Hey [Name], thanks for taking the time. Before we dive in, I saw [relevant detail from research]. How's that going?"
>
> [Brief small talk]
>
> "I want to make sure this is valuable for you. Here's what I'm thinking:
>
> First, I'd love to learn about how you handle performance reviews today and what's working or not.
>
> Then, I can share a bit about what we're building and see if it might be a fit.
>
> Sound good? Anything specific you want to cover?"

### Discovery Questions

**Situation:**
> "Tell me about your team. How many people do you manage directly?"
>
> "Walk me through how you handle performance reviews today."
>
> "Do your employees do self-reviews? How about peer feedback?"

**Pain:**
> "What's the most frustrating part of your current process?"
>
> "How much time do you spend on reviews each cycle?"
>
> "When you finish reviews, where does that documentation go?"

**Impact:**
> "What happens when reviews don't go well or aren't done consistently?"
>
> "Have you ever had a situation where you wished you had better documentation?"

**Aspiration:**
> "If you could wave a magic wand, what would the ideal review process look like?"

### Qualification Questions

**Budget:**
> "Have you looked at any tools for this before? What was your reaction to pricing?"
>
> "Budget-wise, performance tools typically run $6-15 per employee per month. Does that range work for your team?"

**Authority:**
> "If you found something that worked, what would the decision process look like?"

**Timeline:**
> "When's your next review cycle? Would you want something in place by then?"

### Solution Bridge

> "Based on what you've shared, it sounds like [their main pain point] is the biggest issue.
>
> That's exactly why we built this. Here's the quick version:
>
> We help small teams run 360-degree reviews - self-review, peer feedback, manager evaluation - all in one place.
>
> The piece I think you'd find most useful is [specific feature based on their pain]."

### Close

> "The best way to see if this works is to try it with your team.
>
> Would you be open to a free trial? No credit card needed, and I can help you get set up.
>
> [If yes] Great! I'll send you the signup link right after this call. Want me to set up a 15-minute call in a few days to check on progress?"

## Demo Scripts

### Opening

> "Before I show you the product, let me make sure I'm showing you the right things.
>
> Based on our conversation, it sounds like [main pain point]. Is that still the main thing you want to solve?"
>
> [Confirm or adjust]
>
> "Perfect. Let me show you how we handle that specifically."

### Dashboard Walkthrough

> "This is your dashboard. You'll see:
> - Your current review cycle status
> - Who's completed their reviews
> - Who still needs a reminder
>
> No more chasing people - the system handles reminders automatically."

### Self-Review Demo

> "Here's where the magic happens. When an employee fills out their self-review, they rate themselves on each competency.
>
> Then when you fill out your review, you'll see their ratings right next to yours. We call this the gap analysis.
>
> [Show gap analysis view]
>
> See this gap here? They rated themselves a 5 on strategic thinking, you rated them a 3. That's a coaching conversation waiting to happen."

### Peer Feedback Demo

> "For peer feedback, you just select which teammates should review each person.
>
> They get an email, fill out a quick form, and their feedback is anonymized and aggregated.
>
> [Show aggregated view]
>
> You see the themes and averages, but no one knows who said what. It makes people more honest."

### Pricing Walkthrough

> "Let me show you how pricing works.
>
> For your team of [X] employees, it's $[Y] per month - or $[Z] per year if you pay annually, which saves you [%].
>
> That includes everything - unlimited review cycles, all features, no hidden costs.
>
> For context, that's about [40-50%] less than Lattice for the same core features."

### Close Demo

> "Based on what I showed you, do you think this would work for your team?
>
> [Handle any questions/objections]
>
> Great. What would you like to do next? Start a trial? Schedule a call with anyone else who needs to see it?"

## Conversion Call Scripts

### Opening

>

### Review Experience

> "What features have you used most?"
>
> "What did you like?"
>
> "Was there anything confusing or frustrating?"

### Value Confirmation

> "Based on what you've shared, it sounds like [specific value they got].
>
> If you continued using this, how much time do you think you'd save per review cycle?"

### Pricing Presentation

> "Let me walk you through how pricing works for your team.
>
> For [X] employees:
> - Monthly: $[Y]/month
> - Annual: $[Z]/year, which saves you $[amount]
>
> That's about [%] less than tools like Lattice for the same features."

**If not ready:**

## Objection Response Scripts

### "It's too expensive"

> "I hear you. For your team of [X], that's $[Y]/month.
>
> Consider this: each review probably takes you 30+ minutes today. With [X] reviews per cycle, that's [hours]. At your rate, that's worth more than the tool costs.
>
> And that's before the value of better feedback and documentation."

### "We're happy with spreadsheets"

> "Spreadsheets are great for a lot of things.
>
> What made you take this call - is there something that's not working?"
>
> [If they reveal pain, dig in]
>
> [If genuinely happy]
>
> "Makes sense. I'll let you go - but if that changes, keep us in mind."

### "We need [feature you don't have]"

> "Help me understand - how would you use that feature? What problem would it solve?"
>
> [Listen]
>
> "That's not something we have right now. Is it a deal-breaker, or could you work without it?"

### "Let me think about it"

> "Of course. What specifically are you thinking through? I might be able to help."
>
> [Listen]
>
> "What would make this an easy yes for you?"

### "I need to talk to my boss"

> "Totally understand. What do you think they'll want to know?
>
> Would it help if I put together a quick summary you can share with them? Or we could set up a call with them?"
