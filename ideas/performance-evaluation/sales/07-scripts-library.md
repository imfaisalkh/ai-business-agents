## Call Scripts

### 6. Voicemail Script (If They Don't Answer)

> "Hey [Name], this is [Your Name] from TeamPulse. I sent you a LinkedIn message about performance reviews—wanted to see if you'd be open to a quick 15-minute call. We help managers like you run structured reviews without the $2K Lattice price tag. Give me a call back at [phone] or just reply to my LinkedIn message. Thanks!"

*Keep it <30 seconds. Mention LinkedIn message to create touchpoint continuity.*

---

### 7. Demo Opening (First 30 Seconds)

> "Hey [Name]! Thanks for joining. I've got about 10-15 minutes to show you how TeamPulse works. Based on our last call, sounds like gap analysis and peer feedback are your top pain points—so I'll focus there. I'll leave time for questions at the end. Sound good?"

*Set expectations (10-15 min), recap their pain, get buy-in.*

---

### 8. Demo Script (10-Min Walkthrough)

**[Screen 1: Gap Analysis View - 5 min]**

> "Here's the core feature. Sarah submitted her self-review—she rated herself 2 out of 5 on Impact. I rated her 5 out of 5. See the gap? That's a 3-point difference.
>
> This tells me it's a confidence issue, not a skill gap. Without this view, I'd walk into the 1:1 blind. With it, I can say: 'Sarah, why did you rate yourself 2 out of 5? Let me show you the impact you've had.'
>
> Have you ever had someone underrate themselves like this?"

*Pause for engagement. Wait for them to say "yes" or share a story.*

**[Screen 2: Peer Feedback - 3 min]**

> "For peer feedback, Sarah requests feedback from 2-3 teammates. They answer 3 questions in 5-10 minutes. We anonymize responses and aggregate themes automatically.
>
> No Google Forms. No manual aggregation. No 3 hours of copy-pasting.
>
> How do you currently handle peer feedback?"

*Let them share their pain (manual process or skip it entirely).*

**[Screen 3: Dashboard + Setup - 2 min]**

> "Your dashboard shows who's pending, who's done. Setup takes 15 minutes: import team from Slack or CSV, pick a template—Engineer, Manager, Sales Rep with Junior/Mid/Senior levels—and send requests. No training, no 2-week onboarding.
>
> Questions so far?"

---

### 9. Trial Close (After Demo)

**If strong buying signals ("This is exactly what we need"):**

> "Awesome—want to start a trial today? It's 14 days, no credit card required. You can import your team and launch a test review right now. I'll send you the link after this call."

**If neutral signals ("Interesting, let me think about it"):**

> "No pressure—what specifically do you need to think about? Is it pricing, features, timing, or something else?"

*Address their concern, then:*

> "Tell you what—why don't you try the 14-day trial and see if it works for your team? No credit card, no commitment. If it doesn't work, no hard feelings."

**If weak signals ("We're happy with [current solution]"):**

> "Got it—sounds like you've got a system that works. I'll add you to my newsletter and check back in [X] months. In the meantime, here's a free review template: [link]. Best of luck!"

---

### 10. Objection Handling (In-Call)

**Objection: "Too expensive"**

> "I hear you. Let's talk ROI. How long does it take you to do one review right now?"
>
> *[They say 2-4 hours]*
>
> "Okay—so 2-4 hours times 10 people is 20-40 hours per quarter. That's 80-160 hours per year. At your hourly rate, that's $4K-16K in opportunity cost. We cost $720-1,440 per year. You're actually losing money by NOT using us."

**Objection: "Not a priority right now"**

> "Totally fair. When's your next review cycle?"
>
> *[They say date or "not sure"]*
>
> "If it's in the next 90 days, you'll be copy-pasting docs again. What if we set this up in 15 minutes today, so you don't have to think about it until then? Or I can ping you 60 days before your next cycle—which would you prefer?"

**Objection: "We use Lattice"**

> "Lattice is great for enterprise. Can I ask—do you use their peer feedback and gap analysis features?"
>
> *[If NO]*
>
> "So you're paying $11-16 per person for features you're not using. We focus on the 20% of features that drive 80% of value—self-review, gap analysis, peer feedback, goals. You'd save $5-10 per person. Want to see a side-by-side comparison?"

---

## Slack/Text Scripts

### 11. Slack DM (If Connected to Their Workspace)

> "Hey [Name]! Saw you're managing the [team name] team—curious how you handle performance reviews? Most managers I talk to are either copy-pasting docs or paying $2K/year for Lattice. We built something in between—want to see?"

*Keep it casual. Slack is informal, don't sound sales-y.*

---

### 12. LinkedIn Voice Note Script (Alternative to Text DM)

> "Hey [Name], [Your Name] here. Saw your post about [topic]—totally resonated. I'm building a tool to help managers like you run better performance reviews without the Lattice price tag. Would love to hop on a quick 15-min call if you're open. Let me know!"

*Voice notes get 3-5x higher response rates than text on LinkedIn.*

---

## Positioning One-Liners (Use in Any Context)

**Option 1: Problem-focused**
> "We help managers run structured 360-degree performance reviews without spending $2,000+/year on Lattice."

**Option 2: Outcome-focused**
> "We save managers 5+ hours per review cycle with employee self-review gap analysis and automated peer feedback."

**Option 3: Differentiation-focused**
> "We're the only tool at $6-8 per person that shows you side-by-side comparison of employee vs manager ratings—so you coach confidence gaps, not just skill gaps."

**Option 4: ROI-focused**
> "We cost $720/year for a 10-person team and save you 20+ hours per year. That's $1,000-2,000 in value for a $720 investment."

## Closing Questions (Use to Move Deal Forward)

1. **"What would make this a yes for you?"** (Uncover hidden objections)
2. **"If I could solve [their objection], would you start a trial today?"** (Test if objection is real or excuse)
3. **"On a scale of 1-10, how ready are you to fix this problem?"** (Gauge urgency)
4. **"What happens if you don't fix this before your next review cycle?"** (Pain amplification)
5. **"Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"** (Uncover stakeholders)
6. **"Want to do a 3-person pilot first, then expand?"** (Reduce friction)
