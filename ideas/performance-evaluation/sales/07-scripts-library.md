## Demo Scripts

### Demo Opening (2 min)

**Goal:** Set expectations and understand what matters most to them

> "Hey [Name], good to see you again. Thanks for taking the time for this demo.
>
> Before I show you TeamPulse, I want to make sure I focus on what matters most to you. From our discovery call, I remember you mentioned [pain point 1] and [pain point 2].
>
> Is that still accurate? Anything else you want to make sure we cover today?
>
> [Wait for response]
>
> Perfect. Here's how I'll structure this: I'll show you the core review workflow - creating a cycle, writing reviews, and the gap analysis. Should take about 15 minutes, and I'll leave plenty of time for questions. Sound good?"

---

### Demo Flow (15 min)

#### Step 1: Creating a Review Cycle (3 min)

> "Let me show you how easy it is to get started. [Share screen]
>
> This is the dashboard. First thing you'd do is create a review cycle.
>
> [Click 'New Cycle']
>
> Give it a name - 'Q1 2026 Reviews' - set your dates, and now pick a template. We have pre-built templates for engineering, sales, managers - you mentioned you have [X engineers], so let's use the Engineering IC template.
>
> [Select template]
>
> See these competencies? Technical skills, communication, problem-solving - these are customizable, but most teams use them as-is to save time.
>
> Now I add participants - your team. [Add 2-3 names]
>
> And I'm done. That's the whole setup. Takes most people about 10-15 minutes for a real team."

**Transition:**
> "Any questions so far? [Pause] Okay, now let me show you what happens when your team starts using it."

---

#### Step 2: Self-Review (3 min)

> "When you launch the cycle, employees get an email asking them to complete their self-review.
>
> [Show employee view]
>
> Here's what [Employee Name] sees. Same competencies you'll use as a manager - Technical Skills, Communication, etc.
>
> They rate themselves, add comments about their work, and submit. The key thing: they're rating themselves on the EXACT same criteria you'll use. That's what makes the gap analysis work.
>
> [Show rating interface]
>
> See how simple this is? Most employees complete this in 10-15 minutes. We're seeing 80%+ completion rates because it's not intimidating."

---

#### Step 3: Peer Feedback (2 min)

> "While self-reviews are happening, you can also collect peer feedback.
>
> [Show peer selection]
>
> You pick 2-3 peers for each person, they get a short form - takes 5 minutes max - and the feedback is anonymous.
>
> [Show aggregated view]
>
> When I look at the feedback as a manager, I see themes, not individual responses. '3 peers mentioned strong collaboration' - but I don't know which peers said what. That protects honesty."

---

#### Step 4: Manager Review (3 min)

> "Now I write my review. [Show manager review screen]
>
> I see the same competencies, rate them, add my feedback. But look at this sidebar.
>
> [Highlight sidebar]
>
> I can see the peer feedback while I write - so I'm informed by what the team sees. And I can see their goals and what they accomplished this quarter.
>
> When I'm done, I submit - and here's where it gets interesting."

---

#### Step 5: Gap Analysis - THE WOW MOMENT (4 min)

> "This is what makes TeamPulse different. [Click Gap Analysis]
>
> **[Pause and let them see it]**
>
> See this? On the left is how I rated [Employee]. On the right is how they rated themselves. And in the middle - the gap.
>
> Look at Communication: I gave them a 3, they gave themselves a 4.5. That's a gap of 1.5 points.
>
> [Point to highlighted gap]
>
> The system flags this as significant. Now here's the magic: instead of walking into a review meeting with a monologue, I walk in with THIS.
>
> I can say: 'I noticed we see Communication differently. You rated yourself 4.5, I rated you 3. Let's talk about that.'
>
> That's a conversation. That's coaching. That's how people actually grow.
>
> [Show comparison of written feedback]
>
> And look - I can see what they wrote versus what I wrote. They think they're proactive communicators, I see missed updates. Now we have something specific to discuss.
>
> [Pause]
>
> This is the feature people come back and tell me changed their 1:1s. Have you seen anything like this before?"

---

### Demo Close (3-5 min)

**Transition to close:**
> "That's the core of TeamPulse. Self-review, peer feedback, manager reviews, and the gap analysis that ties it all together.
>
> [Pause]
>
> What questions do you have?"

**After questions:**
> "Based on what you've seen, I think this would really help with [their pain point]. The gap analysis alone would make your [Q2] reviews way more productive.
>
> Here's what I'd suggest: start a free trial, add your team, and run a quick test cycle - even with just 2-3 people. See the gap analysis for yourself.
>
> [If yes] Great! I'll send you the signup link right now. I'll check in on Day 3 to see how setup went.
>
> [If hesitation] What's holding you back from trying it?"

---

## Cold Outreach Scripts

### LinkedIn Voice Note (60 seconds)

> "Hey [Name], [Your name] here.
>
> I noticed you're leading the [engineering/HR] team at [Company] - congrats on the growth by the way, saw you just hit [X] people.
>
> I work with managers at similar-sized teams who are dealing with the chaos of performance reviews. The spreadsheet madness, employees never seeing their feedback, that kind of thing.
>
> We built something that might help - basically lets employees rate themselves first, then shows you exactly where your ratings differ from theirs. Makes review conversations way more productive.
>
> Anyway, no pitch - just curious if reviews are something you're dealing with. Happy to share some templates either way.
>
> Have a great [day]!"

---

### Cold Email - Problem-Focused

**Subject:** Performance reviews at [Company]

> Hi [Name],
>
> Quick question: how are you handling performance reviews at [Company] right now?
>
> I ask because I talk to a lot of managers at [team size] companies who tell me the same story: spreadsheets everywhere, employees never see their feedback, and nobody's sure if they're being consistent.
>
> We built TeamPulse to fix that - basically gives you self-reviews, peer feedback, and a side-by-side comparison of how you rate someone vs. how they rate themselves. Setup takes 15 minutes, not 2 weeks.
>
> Worth a 15-minute call to see if it fits? [Calendar link]
>
> Either way, happy to send you our free review template if that's useful.
>
> [Your name]

---

### Cold Email - Trigger-Based (New Manager)

**Subject:** Congrats on the new role!

> Hi [Name],
>
> Saw you recently moved into [new role] at [Company] - congrats!
>
> The first review cycle as a new manager can be tricky. I've been there - you want to give great feedback but the tools are either expensive enterprise stuff or messy spreadsheets.
>
> We built TeamPulse for exactly this situation. Employees do self-reviews first, you rate them on the same criteria, and then you see where your ratings differ. Makes that first feedback conversation way less awkward.
>
> Would a 15-minute walkthrough be useful? [Calendar link]
>
> No pressure either way - just wanted to offer since the timing seemed relevant.
>
> [Your name]

---

## Phone Scripts

### Voicemail (30 seconds max)

> "Hey [Name], [Your name] from TeamPulse.
>
> Following up on the demo we scheduled for [day]. I'll send a calendar invite, but wanted to put a voice to the email.
>
> If the time doesn't work, just reply to my email and we'll find something better.
>
> Talk soon!"

---

### Call Back After Voicemail

> "Hey [Name], [Your name] from TeamPulse - I left you a voicemail earlier about [performance reviews / our demo].
>
> Do you have a quick minute?
>
> [If yes] Great. I wanted to make sure the [time] on [day] still works for you. Also curious - any questions that have come up since we last talked that I should be ready to address?
>
> [If no] No worries, I'll shoot you a quick email. When's a better time to connect?"

---

### Warm Call - Trial Not Engaged

> "Hey [Name], [Your name] from TeamPulse.
>
> I noticed you signed up for a trial [X days] ago but haven't created a review cycle yet. Wanted to check in - is there anything I can help with?
>
> [Wait]
>
> [If they mention blocker] Got it - [address blocker]. Would it help if I walked you through setup right now? It'll take 10 minutes.
>
> [If they mention timing] Totally understand. When do you think you'll have time to dig in? I want to make sure you get value before the trial ends on [date].
>
> [If they're lost] Here's what I'd suggest - let me walk you through the 3-step setup right now. By the time we hang up, you'll have your first cycle created."

---

## Closing Scripts

### Trial-to-Paid Conversion

**Day 10-12 call:**
> "Hey [Name], how's the trial going?
>
> [Listen]
>
> Great to hear. So your trial ends in a few days - I wanted to see where your head's at.
>
> Based on what you've seen, does TeamPulse solve the [pain point they mentioned] problem we talked about?
>
> [If yes] Awesome. Ready to move forward? I can send you the payment link right now - $[X]/month for your [Y] employees.
>
> [If hesitation] What's holding you back? Is it the price, the timing, or something about the product?"

---

### Asking for the Sale

> "Based on everything we've discussed, I think TeamPulse is a great fit for [Company]. You mentioned [pain point 1] and [pain point 2], and we've shown you how the gap analysis solves both.
>
> At $[X] per month for your [Y] employees, this is way cheaper than what you're losing in manager time and review chaos right now.
>
> Can I send you the payment link to get started?"

---

### If They Say "Let Me Think About It"

> "Totally fair - it's a decision worth thinking through.
>
> Can I ask: what specifically are you going to think about? Is it the price, the features, or whether this is the right timing?
>
> [Wait for real objection]
>
> Got it. [Address objection]. Does that help?
>
> Here's my suggestion: let's put a specific time on the calendar to reconnect - say [2-3 days from now]. That way you have time to think, and I can answer any questions that come up. Does [day/time] work?"

---

## Handling "Not Now"

### Graceful Pause

> "I appreciate you being direct. Sounds like the timing isn't right.
>
> A few questions so I can be helpful in the future:
> 1. When's your next review cycle? I'd love to check in before then.
> 2. What would need to change for this to become a priority?
> 3. Is there anyone else at [Company] who might be dealing with this more urgently?
>
> Either way, I'll send you our free review template - might help even if you stick with your current process. And I'll reach out [before their review cycle] to see if anything's changed.
>
> Thanks for considering us!"

---

### Keeping the Door Open

> "No problem at all. Priorities shift.
>
> If it's okay with you, I'll add you to our quarterly newsletter - nothing salesy, just tips on running better reviews and updates on what we're building.
>
> And if reviews ever become a fire to put out, my email's always open. Good luck with [their current priority]!"

---

## Referral Scripts

### Asking for Referrals (After Positive Interaction)

> "I'm glad TeamPulse is working for you. Quick question: do you know any other managers - maybe at other companies or in your network - who deal with the same review headaches you had?
>
> I'd love an introduction if you think they'd benefit. We'll take good care of them, and I'll make sure to mention you sent them."

---

### Following Up on Referral

> "Hey [Referral Name], [Your name] from TeamPulse.
>
> [Referrer Name] suggested I reach out - they mentioned you might be dealing with [pain point].
>
> We've been helping [Referrer's Company] with their performance reviews, and [Referrer] thought you might find it useful too.
>
> Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if there's a fit? [Calendar link]
>
> Either way, happy to send you some free resources if that's helpful."
