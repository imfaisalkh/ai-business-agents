## BANT+ Framework for TeamPulse

### Budget

| Signal | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Has allocated budget for HR/people tools | 3 | "We have $2K/year for tools" |
| Would find budget if value is clear | 2 | "If it saves time, we'd make it work" |
| Needs to check with finance/manager | 1 | "I'd have to ask" |
| No budget, organization won't pay | 0 | "We don't pay for this" |

**Questions to uncover:**
- "Do you have budget allocated for HR or people tools?"
- "How have you purchased similar tools in the past?"
- "Is this the kind of expense you can approve, or does it need sign-off?"

### Authority

| Signal | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Final decision maker for this purchase | 3 | "I can sign off on this" |
| Decision maker with 1 stakeholder | 2 | "Me and my manager decide" |
| Influencer, not decision maker | 1 | "I'd recommend, but HR decides" |
| No influence on purchase | 0 | "I just use what we have" |

**Questions to uncover:**
- "Who would need to be involved in this decision?"
- "Have you purchased software for your team before? How did that work?"

| Future - no timeline, exploring | 1 | "Maybe next year" |
| No timeline - no planned reviews | 0 | "We don't do formal reviews" |

**Questions to uncover:**

## Using Qualification to Prioritize

### Daily Pipeline Review

Sort deals by qualification score, then by:
1. **Timeline** - Closest deadline first
2. **Deal size** - Larger teams = higher ACV
3. **Engagement** - Most responsive first

### Example Priority List
| Rank | Company | Score | Why Priority |
|------|---------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Acme Inc | 13 | HOT, reviews in 2 weeks |
| 2 | Beta Co | 11 | WARM, but 30 employees |
| 3 | Gamma | 10 | WARM, engaged champion |
| 4 | Delta | 7 | COOL, nurture |

### Time Allocation by Score
- HOT (12-15): 50% of sales time
- WARM (8-11): 35% of sales time
- COOL (5-7): 10% of sales time
- NOT A FIT (<5): 5% (just for graceful exit)
