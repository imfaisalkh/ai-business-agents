# Qualification Checklist

## BANT+ Framework

### Budget (B)
- [ ] **Has $500-2,000/year budget for team tools** (ask: "What do you spend on Linear, Notion, Slack?")
- [ ] **Can expense $150-500/month without lengthy approval** (ask: "Can you expense tools directly or need approval?")
- [ ] **Sees ROI in time savings** (30 min/review × 10 people × 4 cycles = 20 hours = $1K+ value)

**Red flags:** "Let me check with finance", "We're bootstrapped with no tool budget", "Need to wait for next fiscal year"

---

### Authority (A)
- [ ] **Manager has decision authority** (ask: "If you found a tool today, what's the process?")
- [ ] **Can sign contract <$5K without procurement** (self-service checkout, no RFP)
- [ ] **Not "checking with team/boss"** (decision maker, not influencer)

**Red flags:** "Need VP/CEO approval", "Have to run by procurement", "Let me talk to my team first" (after 2+ follow-ups)

---

### Need (N)
- [ ] **Clear, specific pain** (not "reviews could be better" but "I waste 10 hours copy-pasting docs")
- [ ] **Pain level 6+/10** (ask: "On a scale of 1-10, how painful is the current process?")
- [ ] **Has tried alternatives and failed** (Google Docs chaos, Lattice too expensive, no tool at all)

**Red flags:** "Reviews are fine, just exploring", "We're happy with our process", "Interesting but not urgent"

---

### Timeline (T)
- [ ] **Next review cycle <90 days away** (urgent, will buy soon)
- [ ] **Or just finished cycle** (pain is fresh, wants to fix before next cycle)
- [ ] **Has deadline** (CEO mandated reviews, new hire requires documentation)

**Red flags:** "Not sure when our next cycle is", "We do reviews ad hoc", "Maybe in 6-12 months"

---

### + Fit Criteria (Team Size, Role, Industry)
- [ ] **Team size: 15-50 employees (ideal) or 5-100 (acceptable)**
- [ ] **Manager role:** Engineering Manager, Product Manager, Operations Manager (ICP match)
- [ ] **Industry:** Tech startup, SaaS, digital agency (tech-savvy, tool adopters)

**Red flags:** <5 employees (too small), >200 employees (need enterprise features), non-manager (no buying authority)

| **Budget** (Has authority + sees ROI) | ×3 | __/10 | __/30 |
| **Authority** (Decision maker) | ×2 | __/10 | __/20 |
| **Need** (Pain level) | ×3 | __/10 | __/30 |
| **Timeline** (Urgency) | ×2 | __/10 | __/20 |
| **Fit** (Team size, role) | ×1 | __/10 | __/10 |
| **Total** | | | **__/110** |

**Scoring:**
- 10 = Perfect fit
- 7-9 = Strong fit
- 4-6 = Medium fit
- 1-3 = Weak fit

**Qualification thresholds:**
- **80-110:** Hot lead → Fast-track to demo + trial
- **60-79:** Warm lead → Demo, but expect longer sales cycle
- **40-59:** Cold lead → Nurture (follow up in 60-90 days)
- **<40:** Disqualify → Polite breakup, exit gracefully

## Buying Signals (Stack Rank Prospects)

### Tier 1: Hot (Close in 7-14 days)
- [ ] **Asked about pricing unprompted** ("How much does this cost?")
- [ ] **Gave referrals** ("You should talk to [name]—they have this problem worse")
- [ ] **Committed to timeline** ("I need this before Q2 reviews in March")
- [ ] **Expressed pain multiple times** ("This is a nightmare every quarter")
- [ ] **Next review cycle <30 days** (immediate urgency)

### Tier 2: Warm (Close in 30-60 days)
- [ ] **Engaged in demo** (asked questions, showed screenshots of their current process)
- [ ] **Confirmed budget exists** ("We pay for Notion and Linear, this would fit")
- [ ] **Scheduled follow-up** (not ghosting)
- [ ] **Next review cycle 30-90 days** (medium urgency)

### Tier 3: Cold (Nurture for 90+ days)
- [ ] **Interested but not urgent** ("Cool idea, but not a priority right now")
- [ ] **No clear pain** ("Reviews are okay, just exploring options")
- [ ] **No timeline** ("Not sure when we'll do reviews next")
- [ ] **Budget unclear** ("I'd have to check")

---

## Disqualification Criteria (Polite Exit)

Disqualify if 3+ of these are true:
- [ ] **No budget authority** ("I need to ask my boss" after 2+ follow-ups)
- [ ] **Wrong team size** (<5 employees or >200 employees)
- [ ] **No pain** (Pain score <5/10)
- [ ] **Happy with status quo** ("Google Docs works fine for us")
- [ ] **No timeline** ("We'll revisit this in 12 months")
- [ ] **Ghost after demo** (3+ follow-ups with no reply)
- [ ] **Wants enterprise features we don't have** (SSO, SAML, custom SLA)

**Disqualification email template:**
