## Detailed Qualification Questions

### Budget Qualification

**Direct questions:**
- "What are you spending on this today - either in tools or time?"
- "We're about $7 per employee per month. For your team of [X], that's roughly $[Y]/month. Does that work with your budget?"
- "Is this something you have budget for, or would you need to get approval?"

**Indirect signals:**
- What other tools are they paying for? (Slack, Notion, Linear = good sign)
- How did they react to pricing mentioned in outreach?
- Are they at a well-funded startup or bootstrapped?

**Qualification threshold:**
- Green: Budget confirmed or "that seems reasonable"
- Yellow: "I'd need to check" (find out who approves)
- Red: "We're not paying for any tools right now"

### Authority Qualification

**Direct questions:**
- "If you found something that worked, what would the decision process look like?"
- "Who else would need to see this before you moved forward?"
- "Are you the person who signs off on new tools for your team?"

**Indirect signals:**
- Job title (Manager, Director, Head of = good)
- How they talk about decisions ("I would" vs "We would need to")
- Previous purchasing behavior

**Decision maker types:**
| Type | Description | Approach |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Solo decision maker** | Can approve on their own | Close directly |

| **Champion** | Loves it but can't sign | Arm with materials |
| **Influencer** | Opinion matters | Get their buy-in |
| **Blocker** | Can say no but not yes | Neutralize concerns |

**Qualification threshold:**
- Green: They are the decision maker or have clear path
- Yellow: Need to involve others (ask who and how)
- Red: Can't identify decision maker or "IT decides"

### Need Qualification

**Direct questions:**
- "What's the most painful part of your current process?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how much of a priority is fixing this?"
- "What happens if you don't change anything?"

**Indirect signals:**

**Qualification threshold:**
- Green: Specific, emotional pain described (bleeding/hurting)
- Yellow: Acknowledges problem but not urgent (annoying)
- Red: "Things are fine" or can't articulate pain

### Timeline Qualification

**Direct questions:**
- "When's your next review cycle?"
- "What's driving your timeline?"
- "If you found the right solution, when would you want it implemented?"

**Indirect signals:**
- Upcoming review cycle (within 60 days = urgent)
- Recent trigger event (bad review, new hire, growth)
- End of quarter/year budget spend

**Qualification threshold:**
- Green: Review cycle in <60 days, wants solution before
- Yellow: 60-90 days out, or "sometime this quarter"

## Disqualification Scripts

### Too Small (<10 employees)

> "Sounds like you've got a tight-knit team. Honestly, at your size, a lightweight process - even just a Google Doc template - might be all you need.
>
> If you grow to 15+ and things get more complex, definitely reach out. In the meantime, I can share a free template if that helps."

### Too Large (>100 employees)

> "At your scale, you might need some features we don't have yet - like HRIS integrations or more complex workflows.
>
> Have you looked at Lattice or 15Five? They're pricier but built for larger teams.
>
> That said, if you want to try us for a specific team or department, we're happy to support that."

### No Budget

> "I appreciate you being upfront about budget.
>
> Just so I understand - is it that there's no budget for tools in general, or that this specifically isn't a priority right now?"

[If no budget for tools:]
> "Got it. That makes sense at your stage. Let me share a free template that might help in the meantime. We can reconnect when the timing is better."

[If not a priority:]
> "Understood. What would need to happen for this to become a priority?"

### No Pain

> "It sounds like you've got things under control - that's great.
>
> Just out of curiosity, what made you take this call? Was there something specific you were curious about?"

[If they reveal hidden pain, dig in]
[If genuinely no pain:]
> "Makes sense. I'll let you go - but if anything changes, feel free to reach out."

### Wrong Persona (Consultant, Vendor, etc.)

> "Appreciate you reaching out! Just to clarify - are you looking for this for your own team, or for clients you work with?"

[If for clients:]
> "Interesting. We're focused on direct users right now, but I'm curious - what are your clients asking for?"

[Capture intel, then:]
> "Thanks for sharing. We're not set up for reseller partnerships yet, but I'll keep you in the loop if that changes."

## Qualification in Practice

### During LinkedIn Outreach

**Quick qualification before call:**
- Company size (check LinkedIn)
- Person's role (check LinkedIn)
- Recent company news (funding, growth)

**In DM conversation:**
> "Before we hop on a call, quick question - how many people are on your team currently?"

### During Discovery Call

**Natural qualification flow:**
1. Open with rapport
2. "Tell me about your team" → Size, structure
3. "Walk me through your process" → Current solution, pain
4. "What's most frustrating?" → Need
5. "What have you tried?" → Budget signals
6. "Who'd need to sign off?" → Authority
7. "When's next cycle?" → Timeline

### During Trial

**Qualify through behavior:**
- Did they add team members? (Serious)
- Did they create a cycle? (High intent)
- Are they responsive to check-ins? (Engaged)
