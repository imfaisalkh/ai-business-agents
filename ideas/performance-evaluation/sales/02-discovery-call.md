## Call Script

### Opening (2 min)

[Small talk - 30 seconds max]

**Set agenda:**

>
> Then, I can share a bit about what we're building and see if it might be a fit.
>
> Sound good? Anything you specifically want to cover?"

---

### Discovery (10 min)

**Situation questions:**

1. > "Tell me about your team. How many people do you manage directly?"

   *Listen for: team size, org structure*

2. > "How do you handle performance reviews today? Walk me through your process."

   *Listen for: tools used, frequency, who's involved*

3. > "Do your employees do self-reviews? How about peer feedback?"

   *Listen for: gaps in their current process*

**Pain questions:**

4. > "What's the most frustrating part of your current process?"

   *Let them talk. Probe: "Why is that frustrating?"*

5. > "How much time do you spend on reviews each cycle?"

   *Listen for: time investment, inefficiency*

6. > "When you finish reviews, where does that documentation go? Can employees see it?"

   *Listen for: visibility issues, documentation problems*

**Impact questions:**

7. > "What happens when reviews don't go well, or aren't done consistently?"

   *Listen for: consequences they've experienced*

8. > "Have you ever had a situation where you wished you had better documentation of performance issues?"

   *Listen for: legal/HR concerns*

**Aspiration questions:**

---

### Qualification (5 min)

**Budget:**
> "Have you looked at any tools for this before? What was your reaction to pricing?"

*If they mention specific tools:*
> "What did you think of [tool]? What stopped you from using it?"

*Direct budget question (if needed):*
> "Budget-wise, performance tools typically run $6-15 per employee per month. Does that range work for your team?"

**Authority:**
> "If you found something that worked, what would the decision process look like? Anyone else who'd need to weigh in?"

**Need:**
> "On a scale of 1-10, how much of a priority is fixing this right now?"

*If low:* "What would need to happen for it to become a priority?"

**Timeline:**
> "When's your next review cycle? Would you want something in place by then?"

---

### Solution Preview (3 min)

**Bridge from their pain:**
> "Based on what you've shared, it sounds like [their main pain point] is the biggest issue.
>
> That's exactly why we built this. Here's the quick version..."

**Position the solution:**
> "We help small teams run 360-degree reviews - self-review, peer feedback, manager evaluation - all in one place.
>
> The piece I think you'd find most useful is [specific feature based on their pain]:
>
> - If time is the issue: "We automate the reminders and collection, so you're not chasing people"
> - If visibility is the issue: "Employees see their own reviews and can compare their self-rating to yours"
> - If peer feedback is desired: "We handle anonymous peer feedback collection and aggregate it for you"
>
> And we're about half the price of tools like Lattice - around $7 per employee."

**Don't do a full demo here.** Save it for the trial.

### Close (3 min)

**Trial invite:**
> "The best way to see if this works is to try it with your team.
>
> Would you be open to a free trial? No credit card needed, and I can help you get set up."

**Handle responses:**

*If yes:*
> "Great! I'll send you the signup link right after this call. Once you're in, add a few team members and create a test review cycle - that's when it clicks.
>
> Want me to set up a 15-minute call in a few days to check in on how it's going?"

*If hesitant:*
> "What's giving you pause?"

[Address concern, then re-ask]

*If not now:*
> "Totally understand. When's your next review cycle? Let me reach out a month before so you have time to evaluate."

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: They're "Just Looking"

> "Totally understand - you're in research mode. What specifically are you trying to figure out?"

[Let them answer, then:]

> "Rather than me talking at you, would it be helpful to just try the product? You can poke around, no commitment, and I'm happy to answer questions as they come up."

### Scenario: They Love Spreadsheets

> "Spreadsheets are great for a lot of things. What made you take this call - is there something that's not working?"

[If they insist spreadsheets are fine:]

> "Sounds like you've got a good system. If that ever changes, keep us in mind. When's a good time to check back?"

### Scenario: They've Tried Everything

> "It sounds like you've done your research. What was missing from the tools you've tried?"

[Their answer reveals what to emphasize]

### Scenario: Price Comes Up Early

> "Great question. We're about $7 per employee per month - so for a team of 25, that's around $175/month.
>
> But before we get too into pricing, I want to make sure we're actually a fit. Tell me more about [redirect to discovery]..."

### Scenario: They Want a Demo Right Away

> "I can definitely show you the product. But I've found demos are more useful when I understand your specific situation first.
>
> Mind if I ask a few questions to make sure I show you the right things?"
