# Discovery Call Framework

## Call Structure (15-20 min)

### Intro (2 min)
"Hey [Name]! Thanks for making time. I've got about 15 minutes—want to understand how you currently do reviews, what's working, what's not. Then I'll show you what we built if it seems like a fit. Sound good?"

---

### Discovery (8-10 min) - Ask, Listen, Qualify

**Q1: Current Process**
"Walk me through your last review cycle—what tools did you use, how long did it take?"

*Listen for:* Google Docs (manual), Lattice (too expensive), nothing (ad hoc)
*Note:* Time spent per review (target: 2-4 hours per person = pain)

**Q2: Pain Point**
"What's the most frustrating part?"

*Listen for:* Copy-pasting, peer feedback aggregation, no employee visibility, inconsistency
*Validate:* "How often does that happen?" + "What's the cost if you don't fix it?"

**Q3: Self-Review**
"Do employees rate themselves first, or do you rate them and then share?"

*Listen for:* No self-review (missed coaching opportunity), self-review but no gap analysis

**Q4: Peer Feedback**
"How do you handle 360-degree peer feedback?"

*Listen for:* Manual (Google Forms + 3 hours aggregating), skip it (too hard), no anonymity

**Q5: Alternatives Evaluated**
"Have you looked at Lattice, 15Five, or other tools?"

*Listen for:* Price objections ($2,500/year too much), complexity (2-week setup), feature mismatch

**Q6: Budget (BANT)**
"What do you currently spend on team tools like Linear, Notion, Slack?"

*Listen for:* "$50-200/month" = has budget, "Let me check" = no authority (red flag)

**Q7: Timeline**
"When's your next review cycle?"

*Listen for:* <90 days = urgent, ">6 months" = not urgent (nurture), "ad hoc" = no process (harder sell)

**Q8: Decision Process**
"If you found something today, what's the approval process?"

*Listen for:* "I can decide" = great, "Need VP approval" = longer cycle, "Procurement" = enterprise (not a fit)

### Qualification Scorecard (Fill During Call)

| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Pain level (1-10)** | __/10 | 8+ = strong, 5-7 = medium, <5 = weak |
| **Budget authority** | Yes/No | Can they expense $150/month? |
| **Team size fit** | Yes/No | 15-50 ideal, 5-100 acceptable |
| **Timeline urgency** | High/Med/Low | High = <90 days, Med = 90-180, Low = >180 |
| **Current tool** | Docs/Competitor/None | Docs = easiest, None = harder, Competitor = positioning battle |
| **Buying signals** | Strong/Weak | Strong = "When can I buy?", Weak = "Interesting..." |

**Pass threshold:** 4+ Yes/Strong scores + Pain >6 = Qualified lead → Proceed to demo

**Fail threshold:** <4 Yes/Strong OR Pain <5 = Not qualified → Nurture or disqualify

---

### Transition to Demo (1 min)

**If qualified:**
"Got it—sounds like gap analysis and peer feedback automation would save you 5+ hours per cycle. Want me to show you how that works? I can do a quick 10-min walkthrough."

**If not qualified:**
"Thanks for sharing! Based on what you said, I don't think we're the right fit right now [explain why]. But I'll send you some free templates and keep you on my radar. Does that work?"

---

### Demo (10 min) - Show Value, Address Objections

**Screen 1: Gap Analysis View (5 min - CORE DIFFERENTIATOR)**
"Here's Sarah's self-review. She rated herself 2/5 on Impact. I rated her 5/5. See the gap? This tells me it's a confidence issue, not a skill gap. Without this view, I'd walk into the 1:1 blind."

*Pause for reaction.* "Have you ever had someone underrate themselves like this?"

**Screen 2: Peer Feedback Aggregation (3 min)**
"Employees request feedback from 2-3 peers. Peers answer 3 questions in 5 minutes. We anonymize and aggregate themes automatically. No Google Forms, no manual work."

**Screen 3: Dashboard (2 min)**
"Your dashboard shows who's pending, who's done. Takes 15 minutes to set up—import from Slack or CSV, pick a template (Engineer, Manager, Sales), send requests. No 2-week onboarding."

---

### Handle Objections (See sales/04-objection-handling.md)

Common objections:
- "Too expensive" → ROI framing (saves 30 min/review = 20 hrs/year = $1K value)
- "We use Lattice" → "Are you using peer feedback + gap analysis? If not, you're paying $11+ for features we offer at $6-8."
- "Not a priority" → "When's your next cycle? Let's revisit 60 days before."

---

### Close (2 min)

**Strong buying signals (asked about pricing, said "this solves our problem"):**
"Want to try it? 14-day free trial, no credit card. You can import your team and launch a test review today. I'll send the signup link now."

**Neutral signals (interested but hesitant):**
"No pressure—want to try the trial and see if it works for your team? I'll check in on Day 3 to help with setup."

**Weak signals (lukewarm):**
"Sounds like the timing's not right. I'll add you to my newsletter and follow up in [X] months before your next cycle. Sound fair?"
