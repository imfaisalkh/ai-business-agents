## Call Structure

### Opening (2 min)

**Goal:** Set expectations, build rapport

> "Hey [Name], thanks for taking the time. Before we dive in, I want to make sure this is valuable for you. I have about [20-30] minutes - does that work on your end?"

> "My goal today is to understand how you're handling performance reviews and see if there's a fit with what we're building. I'll ask a bunch of questions, and at the end, if it makes sense, I can show you what TeamPulse does. Sound good?"

**Build rapport:**
- "How long have you been at [Company]?"
- "I saw [recent post/company news] - how's that going?"

---

### Discovery Questions (15-20 min)

*Listen for:*
- [ ] "That would be huge" (core value resonates)
- [ ] "We already do that" (validate current state)
- [ ] "Not sure" (may need education)

**Q11: Gap Analysis Hook**

### Qualification Check (1 min, internal)

While they're talking, score mentally:

| Criteria | Yes | Partial | No |
|----------|-----|---------|-----|
| Has the pain | +2 | +1 | 0 |
| Right team size (10-50) | +2 | +1 | 0 |
| Has budget/authority | +2 | +1 | 0 |
| Timeline exists | +2 | +1 | 0 |
| Engaged in call | +2 | +1 | 0 |

**Score 7+:** Proceed to demo pitch
**Score 4-6:** Needs nurturing or follow-up
**Score <4:** Gracefully disqualify

---

### Transition to Close (3-5 min)

**If Qualified (Score 7+):**

> "Based on what you've shared, I think TeamPulse could really help here. You mentioned [their main pain], and that's exactly what we built for.

> The gap analysis feature I mentioned - where you see your ratings versus theirs side-by-side - that's something most people haven't seen before and it changes how review conversations go.

> Would you be interested in a 15-20 minute demo where I can show you how it works with a team like yours?"

**If Interested:**
> "Great! I have availability [offer 2-3 times]. What works for you?"

**If Hesitant:**
> "Totally understand. What would be helpful to see or know before scheduling that?"

---

**If Needs Nurturing (Score 4-6):**

> "I appreciate you sharing all of this. It sounds like reviews are on your radar but maybe not the top priority right now.

> Would it be helpful if I sent you our performance review template? It's free, and even if you stick with spreadsheets, it might make your next cycle a bit easier.

> And let's plan to reconnect in [30/60/90 days] before your next review cycle?"

---

**If Disqualifying (Score <4):**

> "Thanks for the conversation. Based on what you've shared, it sounds like [reason - too small, no pain, different needs] - so TeamPulse might not be the best fit right now.

> I can still send you some free resources that might help. And if things change - team grows, reviews become more painful - I'm here."

---

### Wrap Up (1-2 min)

> "Before we go, is there anything else I should know about your review process that I didn't ask about?"

> "Also, do you know other managers dealing with similar challenges? I'd love an introduction if you think it'd be helpful for them."

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: They're Happy with Spreadsheets

**What to say:**
> "Spreadsheets totally work, especially at smaller scale. What I hear from teams around your size is that it starts breaking down when you want employees to see their reviews, or when you're trying to compare across quarters. Have you run into any of that?"

**Goal:** Plant seed of future pain, offer template, add to nurture

---

### Scenario: They Use a Competitor

**What to say:**
> "Nice, [Competitor] is a solid tool. What do you like about it? And is there anything you wish was different?"

**Listen for switching triggers:**
- Too expensive
- Too complicated
- Missing features (especially self-review gap analysis)
- Poor support

**If happy:** "Sounds like you're in good shape. If that ever changes, let me know. Happy to send some comparison info in case it's useful down the road."

---

### Scenario: They Want to Skip Discovery

**What to say:**
> "Totally get it - you're busy and want to cut to the chase. Can I ask just 2-3 quick questions so I can make the demo actually relevant? I promise it'll make our time together much more valuable."

**If they insist on demo:**
> "Sure, let's do it. I'll ask questions as we go so I can show you what matters most."

---

### Scenario: Multiple Decision Makers

**What to say:**
> "Got it - so [Person A] and [Person B] would also need to be involved. Would it make sense to include them on the demo call? Or would you prefer to see it first and then bring them in?"

**Goal:** Either get them on demo, or arm your champion with info to sell internally

---

### Scenario: No Budget

**What to say:**
> "Makes sense - budgets are tight everywhere. Quick question: if TeamPulse saved you 5 hours per review cycle - let's say 50 hours a year for your team - would that justify finding $1,500? Or is the budget constraint more structural?"

**Goal:** Understand if it's truly no budget or if value > cost could unlock budget
