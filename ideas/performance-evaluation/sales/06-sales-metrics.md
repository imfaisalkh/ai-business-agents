# Sales Metrics Dashboard

## North Star Metric

**Monthly Closed-Won Deals:** 0 → 2-3 by Month 3, 5-7 by Month 6

**Target:** $3-5K MRR by Month 6 (30-50 paying customers at $90-150 ARPA)

---

## Primary Metrics (Track Weekly)

### 1. Qualified Leads per Week
**Definition:** Leads who pass BANT+ scorecard (see sales/03-qualification-checklist.md)

**Target:** 3-5 qualified leads/week by Week 8

**Current:** 0 (pre-launch)

**Why it matters:** Sales funnel starts here. If <2/week, marketing isn't working.

---

### 2. Demo-to-Trial Conversion Rate
**Definition:** % of demos that result in trial signups

**Target:** >70%

**Calculation:** (Trial signups / Demos held) × 100

**Why it matters:** Validates product-market fit. If <50%, demo isn't compelling or wrong ICP.

---

### 3. Trial-to-Paid Conversion Rate
**Definition:** % of trials that convert to paying customers

**Target:** >25%

**Calculation:** (Paid customers / Trial signups) × 100

**Why it matters:** Core monetization metric. If <15%, pricing or product value is wrong.

---

### 4. Average Contract Value (ACV)
**Definition:** Average annual revenue per customer

**Target:** $1,440-1,920 (20 employees × $6-8 PEPM × 12 months)

**Current:** N/A (pre-launch)

**Why it matters:** Determines CAC payback and unit economics. Higher ACV = healthier business.

---

### 5. Sales Cycle Length
**Definition:** Days from first contact to closed-won

**Target:** 14-21 days

**Calculation:** Median days across all closed deals

**Why it matters:** Faster cycles = more revenue per month. If >30 days, qualification or urgency is weak.

---

### 6. Close Rate (Qualified Lead → Closed-Won)
**Definition:** % of qualified leads who become paying customers

**Target:** >25%

**Calculation:** (Closed-won deals / Qualified leads) × 100

**Why it matters:** Efficiency metric. If <15%, sales process or product needs work.

## Funnel Metrics (Weekly Tracking)

| Stage | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | Week 4 | Target |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Qualified Leads** | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 3-5/week |
| **Demos Held** | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 2-3/week |
| **Trial Signups** | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 70% of demos |
| **Paid Conversions** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 25% of trials |
| **MRR Added** | $0 | $0 | $0 | $120 | $300-500/week |

**Cumulative MRR Growth:**
- Month 1: $0-500
- Month 2: $500-1,500
- Month 3: $1,500-3,000
- Month 6: $3,000-5,000

---

## Sales Activity Metrics (Leading Indicators)

### Outreach Volume
- **LinkedIn connection requests sent:** 25-50/week
- **Follow-up messages sent:** 20-40/week
- **Discovery calls booked:** 3-5/week
- **Demos held:** 2-3/week

### Response Rates
- **LinkedIn reply rate:** >20% (if <15%, messaging is off)
- **Discovery call show rate:** >70% (if <50%, qualification is weak)
- **Demo show rate:** >80% (if <70%, not confirming properly)

---

## Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Formula:** (Marketing spend + Sales time cost) / New customers

**Example Month 3:**
- Marketing spend: $60/month (LinkedIn Premium $50 + hosting $10)
- Sales time: 40 hours/month founder time × $50/hour (opportunity cost) = $2,000
- Total cost: $2,060
- New customers: 2-3
- **CAC: $687-1,030**

**Target CAC:** <$1,000 in first 6 months (acceptable for founder-led sales)

**CAC Payback Period:**
- $1,000 CAC ÷ $120 MRR = 8.3 months
- Target: <12 months (healthy for bootstrapped SaaS)

---

## LTV:CAC Ratio

**Formula:** Customer Lifetime Value / Customer Acquisition Cost

**LTV Calculation:**
- ARPA: $120/month
- Gross margin: 85% (SaaS margins)
- Churn rate: 5%/month (estimate)
- LTV: $120 × 0.85 / 0.05 = $2,040

**LTV:CAC Ratio:**
- $2,040 LTV / $1,000 CAC = 2.0x

**Target:** >3.0x (healthy SaaS business)

**What to improve:**
- Reduce CAC (better qualification, faster sales cycle)
- Increase LTV (reduce churn, upsell to Growth plan)

## Deal Stage Velocity

*How fast do deals move through funnel?*

| Stage | Avg Time in Stage | Target | Red Flag (Too Slow) |
|-------|-------------------|--------|----------------------|
| Lead → Qualified | 1-3 days | 2 days | >7 days (not responding) |
| Qualified → Demo | 1-3 days | 2 days | >7 days (low interest) |
| Demo → Trial Signup | 0-1 days | Same day | >3 days (not convinced) |
| Trial Signup → Active Use | 0-3 days | 1 day | >7 days (onboarding broken) |
| Trial → Paid | 14-21 days | 17 days | >30 days (not seeing value) |

**Total:** 17-31 days (target: <21 days)

## Win/Loss Analysis (Track Monthly)

### Why We Win (Ask every new customer)
- [ ] "Gap analysis feature—no one else has this at this price"
- [ ] "50% cheaper than Lattice"
- [ ] "15-minute setup vs 2-week onboarding"
- [ ] "Tried competitor, too complex/expensive"
- [ ] "Tired of Google Docs chaos"

### Why We Lose (Ask churned trials)
- [ ] "Too expensive for our budget"
- [ ] "Went with Lattice (bigger brand, more features)"
- [ ] "Stuck with Google Docs (not painful enough yet)"
- [ ] "Team too small (<10 people)"
- [ ] "Timing—not doing reviews for 6+ months"

**Use insights to refine:**
- ICP targeting (avoid teams <10 people)
- Positioning (emphasize gap analysis differentiation)
- Pricing (test $5 PEPM if price objections dominate)

## Red Flags (Investigate Immediately)

- [ ] **Qualified leads <2/week for 2 weeks** → Marketing isn't working, go back to outreach
- [ ] **Demo-to-trial <50%** → Demo isn't compelling, refine script or target wrong ICP
- [ ] **Trial-to-paid <15%** → Product doesn't deliver value or pricing is wrong
- [ ] **Sales cycle >30 days** → Qualification is weak (leads aren't urgent)
- [ ] **CAC >$1,500** → Spending too much time on wrong leads, tighten qualification
- [ ] **Churn >7%/month** → Product-market fit issue, pause sales and fix product
