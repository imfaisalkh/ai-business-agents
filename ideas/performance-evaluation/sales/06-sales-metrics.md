|--------|------------|--------------|--------------|
| New MRR | Revenue from new customers | $500 | $1,500 |
| Churned MRR | Revenue lost to churn | <$100 | <$200 |

| Win Rate | Deals won / Deals closed | 55% |

### Revenue Formula

```
Monthly Revenue Target: $1,500 MRR

Deals needed: $1,500 / $120 ARPA = 12.5 → 13 customers

Pipeline needed (at 55% win rate): 13 / 0.55 = 24 opportunities

Trials needed (at 50% opp rate): 24 / 0.50 = 48 trials

Qualified leads needed (at 60% trial rate): 48 / 0.60 = 80 qualified leads

Total leads needed (at 50% qual rate): 80 / 0.50 = 160 leads
```

## Pipeline Metrics

### Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Count | Value | Avg Age |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Qualified | 12 | $1,440 | 5 days |
| Trial | 8 | $960 | 10 days |
| Engaged | 5 | $600 | 15 days |
| Opportunity | 4 | $480 | 20 days |
| **Total** | **29** | **$3,480** | - |

### Pipeline Health Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Target | Red Flag |
|--------|------------|--------|----------|
| Pipeline Coverage | Pipeline value / Monthly target | 3-4x | <2x |
| Pipeline Velocity | Deals moving forward / Total | 70%+ | <50% |
| Stalled Deals | No activity >7 days | <20% | >30% |
| Average Age | Days in pipeline | <25 days | >35 days |

### Pipeline Coverage Calculation

```
Monthly Revenue Target: $1,500
Current Pipeline Value: $3,480
Coverage Ratio: $3,480 / $1,500 = 2.32x

Status: Below target (need 3x coverage)
Action: Increase top of funnel
```

---

## Sales Velocity

### Formula

```
Sales Velocity = (# of Opps × Deal Value × Win Rate) / Sales Cycle Length

Example:
(10 opps × $120 × 55%) / 25 days = $26.40/day = $792/month
```

### Velocity Levers

| Lever | Current | Target | Impact |
|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| Opportunities | 10/month | 15/month | +50% revenue |
| Deal Value | $120 | $140 | +17% revenue |
| Win Rate | 55% | 65% | +18% revenue |
| Sales Cycle | 25 days | 20 days | +25% revenue |

**Easiest lever:** Reduce sales cycle (faster follow-up, better qualification)
