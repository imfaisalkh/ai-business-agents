- SMB buyers prefer to try before they buy
- Founder expertise builds trust and product feedback loop
- Self-serve trial with sales assist for conversion

## Conversion Call Framework

### Before the Call (5 min prep)

### Call Structure (15-20 min)

**1. Open (2 min)**
> "Thanks for hopping on. I wanted to check in on your trial and see how things are going. How's the experience been so far?"

**2. Review Experience (5 min)**
- What features have they used?
- What did they like?
- What was confusing or frustrating?

**3. Value Confirmation (3 min)**
> "Based on what you've shared, it sounds like [specific value]. Is that accurate?"
> "If you continued using this, how much time do you think you'd save?"

**4. Transition to Pricing (2 min)**
> "Let me walk you through how pricing works and what makes sense for your team."

**5. Present Pricing (3 min)**
- Their team size: [X] employees
- Monthly: $[X]/month
- Annual: $[X]/year (save [X]%)
- Remind: "That's about [X]% less than Lattice for the same features"

**6. Handle Objections (3-5 min)**
- See Objection Handling artifact
- Don't be defensive, be curious

## Pricing Presentation

### Team Size Calculator

| Team Size | Monthly | Annual | Savings |
|-----------|---------|--------|---------|
| 15 | $120 | $1,260 | $180 |
| 20 | $160 | $1,680 | $240 |
| 25 | $200 | $2,100 | $300 |
| 30 | $240 | $2,520 | $360 |
| 40 | $320 | $3,360 | $480 |
| 50 | $400 | $4,200 | $600 |

### Value Framing

> "For a team of 25, that's $200/month - about $8 per person.
>
> Consider that each review saves you about 30 minutes. With 25 people, that's 12+ hours saved per review cycle. At your billing rate, that's easily $500-1,000 in time saved each quarter.
>
> And that's before you factor in the value of better feedback and documentation."

### Competitive Framing

> "Lattice would cost you $275-400/month for the same features. We're about 40% less.
>
> The main difference is we focus on what small teams actually need - self-reviews, peer feedback, gap analysis - without all the enterprise features you'd never use."
