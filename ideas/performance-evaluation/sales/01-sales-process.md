# Sales Process Design

> **Purpose:** Defines the complete sales process for TeamPulse. Founder-led sales playbook for closing first 50 customers.
>
> **Fits in:** Works with ICP (marketing/01) and Positioning (marketing/02). Connects to Discovery Call (02) and Qualification (03).

## Sales Philosophy

**Approach:** Founder-led, consultative sales
**Cycle type:** Product-led with sales assist (self-serve signup + conversion help)
**Target deal size:** $1,200-2,400 ACV (10-20 employee teams)

**Core beliefs:**
1. **Help, don't sell** - Understand their problem, show how we solve it
2. **Qualify hard** - Better to disqualify early than waste time on bad fits
3. **Speed wins** - Respond in hours, not days. First to engage often wins.
4. **Demo the WOW** - Gap analysis should make them say "I need this"

**Sales Velocity = (Opportunities x Win Rate x Deal Size) / Sales Cycle Length**

### Current Targets

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Opportunities/month | 10-15 | Qualified prospects in pipeline |
| Win rate | 25-30% | Trial to paid |
| Average deal size | $1,440 | 20 employees x $6 x 12 months |

**Target velocity:** (12 x 0.27 x $1,440) / 21 = $222/day = $6,660/month potential
