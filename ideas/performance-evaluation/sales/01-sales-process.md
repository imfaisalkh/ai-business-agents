     (Day 0)         (Day 1-3)      (Day 3-5) (14 days) (Day 17-21)
```

### Stage 1: Outreach & Qualification (Days 0-3)

- **Goal:** Qualify (BANT+), validate pain, determine fit
- **Success metric:** 60%+ of calls are qualified (pass scorecard)

### Stage 3: Demo (Days 3-5, 15 min)
- **Format:** Screen share walkthrough (gap analysis feature focus)
- **Goal:** Show value, address objections, get trial signup
- **Success metric:** 70%+ of qualified leads start trial

### Stage 4: 14-Day Free Trial
- **Self-service:** User imports team, launches first review
- **Light-touch:** Day 3 check-in email, Day 7 "Need help?" email, Day 12 "Upgrade now" email
- **Goal:** User completes 1-2 reviews, sees value
- **Success metric:** 25%+ trial-to-paid conversion

### Stage 5: Close (Days 17-21)
- **Trigger:** Trial day 12-14, send upgrade prompt
- **Format:** Self-service checkout OR 15-min close call if hesitant

- **Pass:** Manager can make decision (sole authority or <24 hour approval)
- **Fail:** Requires VP/CEO sign-off with 30+ day procurement cycle

### Need
- **Question:** "Walk me through your last review cycle—what was most frustrating?"

- **Fail:** "Reviews are fine, just exploring" (no urgency)

### Timeline
- **Question:** "When's your next review cycle?"
- **Pass:** <90 days away (urgent) or just finished cycle (pain is fresh)

## Deal Stages (Track in CRM/Notion)

| Stage | Definition | Actions | Exit Criteria |
|-------|------------|---------|---------------|
| **1. Lead** | Replied to outreach, not yet qualified | Send discovery call invite | Books call OR disqualifies |
| **2. Qualified** | Passed BANT+ scorecard | Schedule demo, send pre-demo email | Attends demo OR no-show (move to nurture) |
| **3. Demo Complete** | Saw product, addressed objections | Send trial signup link, follow up | Starts trial OR declines |
| **4. Trial Active** | Using product (self-service) | Day 3 check-in, Day 7 help offer, Day 12 upgrade prompt | Converts to paid OR trial expires |
| **5. Closed-Won** | Paying customer | Onboarding email, add to customer Slack | — |
| **6. Closed-Lost** | Declined or churned | Document reason, add to nurture (follow up in 90 days) | — |

## Sales Velocity Metrics

**Formula:** (# of qualified leads × Close rate × ACV) / Sales cycle length

**Example:**
- 10 qualified leads/month
- 25% close rate = 2.5 customers
- $1,680 ACV (20 employees × $7 × 12 months)
- 21-day sales cycle

**Monthly revenue:** 2.5 customers × $1,680 = $4,200 ARR added/month = $350 MRR added

**Target by Month 6:** 10-15 qualified leads/month → $5-8K MRR

## Red Flags (Disqualify Fast)

- [ ] "We're happy with Google Docs" + no pain expressed = Not a fit
- [ ] "Let me talk to my team first" after 3 follow-ups = Decision paralysis
- [ ] "Can you do [enterprise feature X]?" + <50 employees = Wrong fit
- [ ] Ghost after demo (no reply to 3 follow-ups) = Not interested, move to nurture
- [ ] Trial signup but 0 activity after 7 days = Low intent, send breakup email
