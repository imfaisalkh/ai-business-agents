# Business Context

*This is a FICTIONAL EXAMPLE showing what a completed business context looks like.*

## The Problem

**What specific problem are you solving?**

Freelancers lose $10,000+ annually to late payments. They spend 3-5 hours/week chasing overdue invoices with awkward follow-up emails, damaging client relationships and creating cash flow anxiety. 68% of freelancers report being paid late on at least half their invoices.

**Who has this problem?**

Independent freelancers (designers, developers, consultants, writers) earning $50k-$200k/year who send 5-20 invoices per month. Solo operators without an admin assistant or bookkeeper.

**How are they solving it today?**

- Manual follow-up emails (copy-paste templates, remembering to send)
- Expensive invoicing tools with payment reminders as an afterthought (FreshBooks, QuickBooks)
- Ignoring overdue invoices and hoping clients pay eventually
- Hiring a VA or bookkeeper ($500+/month)

**Why is the current solution inadequate?**

- Manual follow-ups are inconsistent and easy to forget
- Existing tools bury reminder features in complex accounting software
- Following up feels awkward—freelancers avoid it, lose money
- No tool focuses specifically on the *relationship-preserving* aspect of payment collection

## Your Solution

**One-sentence description:**

InvoiceReminder sends polite, perfectly-timed payment follow-ups on your behalf so you get paid faster without awkward conversations.

**Key differentiator (pick ONE):**

Tone-aware messaging. Our follow-ups sound like YOU wrote them, preserving client relationships. Not generic "Your invoice is overdue" spam.

**Initial feature set (3-5 features max):**

1. Connect to existing invoicing tool (Stripe, PayPal, FreshBooks)
2. Automated reminder sequence (3 days before due, day of, 3/7/14 days late)
3. Customizable message templates with tone control (friendly → firm)
4. Dashboard showing payment status and which clients need attention
5. One-click pause (for clients with known payment delays)

## Business Model

**How will you make money?**

Monthly subscription, tiered by number of clients/invoices tracked.

**Target price point:**

$19/month (Starter: up to 20 active invoices)
$39/month (Pro: unlimited invoices + advanced sequences)

**Why this price?**

- Below $20 "impulse buy" threshold for freelancers
- Pays for itself if it collects ONE overdue invoice
- Competitors charge $15-50/month for full invoicing suites; we're cheaper for focused functionality
- $19 signals "professional tool" not "toy"

## Your Unfair Advantages

*Check all that apply and explain:*

- [x] **Domain expertise** - You've lived this problem
- [x] **Technical skills** - You can build it yourself
- [ ] **Existing audience** - You have distribution
- [x] **Unique insight** - You know something others don't
- [x] **Speed** - You can ship faster than incumbents

**Explanation:**

I freelanced for 5 years and lost ~$15k to late payments. I know exactly how awkward it feels to chase money. I can build this in 3 weeks because it's a focused tool, not a full invoicing suite. My insight: freelancers don't need better invoicing—they need better *collecting*.

## Constraints & Preferences

**Budget for tools/marketing:** $200/month

**Time available:** 20 hours/week

**Technical stack preference:**

Nuxt 3 + Vue + SQLite (as recommended). Stripe for payments, Resend for emails.

**Go-to-market preference:**

LinkedIn outreach to freelancer communities + content marketing (Reddit, Twitter, freelancer Slack groups). No paid ads initially.

---

## Success Criteria

**6-month goal:**

$3k MRR (150-200 paying customers at $19/month average)

**What does "validated" look like?**

- 20 paying customers who signed up without a discount
- <10% monthly churn
- At least 3 customers who proactively recommend to other freelancers
