- [ ] Based on real customer conversations (not assumptions)
- [ ] Validated with at least 5-10 actual customers/prospects
- [ ] Specific enough to identify on LinkedIn/social
- [ ] Pain points are urgent (not nice-to-have)

## 7. One-Sentence ICP Statement

Combine everything into one targeting statement:

> **Our ideal customer is a [ROLE] at a [COMPANY TYPE] who struggles with [PRIMARY PAIN] and needs [SOLUTION] to achieve [GOAL] within [TIMELINE].**

Example:
> *Our ideal customer is a **Head of Growth** at a **B2B SaaS startup (10-50 employees, $1M-$5M ARR)** who struggles with **manual outbound prospecting eating 10+ hours/week** and needs **automated lead enrichment** to achieve **2x pipeline** within **90 days**.*
