| **Gains** | [What would success look like?] |

### Product Side

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|

## 4. Messaging by Awareness Stage

### Unaware
*They don't know they have a problem*

**Hook:** [Provocative statement or question]
**Message:** [Educate on the problem]

Example:
> "Most B2B founders spend 40% of their time on lead gen that a $99/month tool can automate."

### Problem Aware
*They know the problem but not the solution*

**Hook:** [Name their pain specifically]
**Message:** [Introduce solution category]

Example:
> "Tired of manually researching prospects on LinkedIn? There's a better way."

### Solution Aware
*They know solutions exist, evaluating options*

**Hook:** [Differentiate from alternatives]
**Message:** [Why you're the best choice]

Example:
> "Unlike enterprise tools built for sales teams, we're built for solo founders who need results, not complexity."

### Product Aware
*They know you, need final push*

**Hook:** [Social proof + urgency]
**Message:** [Specific offer + CTA]

Example:
> "Join 500+ bootstrapped founders who've automated their outbound. Start your free trial."
