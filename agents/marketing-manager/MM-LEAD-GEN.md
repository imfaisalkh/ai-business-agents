## 2. Inbound Lead Generation Tactics

### Tactic 1: Lead Magnet Strategy

**High-Converting Lead Magnet Types:**
| Type | Conversion Rate | Best For |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| Template/Swipe File | High | Practical users |
| Calculator/Tool | High | Data-driven users |
| Checklist | Medium-High | Action-oriented users |
| Mini-Course | Medium | Learners |
| Ebook/Guide | Medium | Research phase |
| Webinar | Medium-High | Engaged users |

**Lead Magnet Creation Framework:**
```
1. Pick ONE specific pain point from ICP
2. Create a quick win (not comprehensive guide)
3. Deliver immediate value
4. Naturally lead to your paid product
5. Keep consumption time under 15 minutes

Title Formula: "The [Specific Outcome] [Format]"
Examples:
- "The 10-Email Cold Outreach Sequence That Books Meetings"
- "The B2B SaaS Pricing Calculator"
- "The LinkedIn Profile Optimization Checklist"
```

### Tactic 2: Content Upgrade Strategy
```
For each blog post, create a related bonus:
- Blog: "How to write cold emails"
- Upgrade: "Download our 5 best-performing cold email templates"

Placement: Pop-up at 50% scroll + inline in content + end of post
Expected lift: 3-5x more leads than generic newsletter signup
```

### Tactic 3: Exit Intent Popup
```
Trigger: When cursor moves to close tab
Offer: High-value lead magnet
Copy: "Wait! Before you go..."
Expected capture rate: 2-4% of leaving visitors
```

### Tactic 4: Chat/Chatbot
```
Use case: Capture visitors who have questions
Triggers:
- After 30 seconds on pricing page
- After viewing 3+ pages
- On high-intent pages

Script:
"Hey! 👋 Have questions about [product]? 
I'm here to help. What brought you here today?"
```

## 3. Outbound Lead Generation Tactics

### Tactic 1: LinkedIn Prospecting System

**Daily Target:** 20 new connections + 10 conversations

**Prospecting Workflow:**
```
1. Use Sales Navigator (or free search) with ICP filters
2. Save prospects to list
3. Send personalized connection request
4. Wait for acceptance
5. Execute follow-up sequence (see MM-CHANNELS.md)
6. Move engaged prospects to CRM
```

**Personalization Research (2 minutes per prospect):**
- Recent LinkedIn post → comment on it
- Company news → mention it
- Mutual connection → reference them
- Job change → congratulate
- Content they shared → compliment specific point

### Tactic 2: Cold Email System

**Daily Targets:**
- Send: 50-100 cold emails
- Target reply rate: 5%+
- Target meeting rate: 1-2%

**List Building Sources:**
| Source | Quality | Cost | Volume |
|--------|---------|------|--------|
| Apollo.io | Medium-High | $-$$ | High |
| Hunter.io | Medium | $ | Medium |
| LinkedIn Sales Nav | High | $$ | Medium |
| Manual Research | Highest | Time | Low |

**Email Validation:**
Always validate emails before sending (use NeverBounce, ZeroBounce)
Target: <3% bounce rate

### Tactic 3: Warm Outreach to Network

**Referral Ask Template:**
```
Hey [Name],

Quick favor: I'm helping [ICP description] with [outcome].

Do you know anyone who:
- [Criteria 1]
- [Criteria 2]
- [Criteria 3]?

I'd be happy to return the favor. Who should I be introducing you to?

Thanks!
[Your name]
```

**Network Activation Cadence:**
- Monthly: Ask 10 contacts for referrals
- Quarterly: Reach out to entire network with update
- Ongoing: Share wins and ask for intros

## 4. Lead Capture Optimization

### Form Optimization

**Fields (Less = More Conversions):**

*High-intent offers (demo, trial):*
```
Required: Email, First Name
Optional: Company, Phone
Hidden: UTM parameters, page source
```

*Low-intent offers (lead magnet):*
```
Required: Email only
Hidden: UTM parameters
```

**Form Placement:**
- Above the fold on landing pages
- End of blog posts
- Sticky sidebar on long content
- Pop-ups (exit intent, scroll-triggered)

### Lead Source Tracking

**UTM Parameter Structure:**
```
utm_source = [Platform: linkedin, google, twitter]
utm_medium = [Type: organic, paid, email, referral]
utm_campaign = [Campaign name]
utm_content = [Specific asset/ad]

Example:
yoursite.com/landing?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=launch2024&utm_content=founder-story-post
```
